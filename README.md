CMPSCI220 Course Materials
==========================

This repository holds all course materials for CMPSCI220. The root directory
holds a [Vagrant] environemnt that you should use for any course development,
from updating the website to hacking on code.

The Vagrant environment has the same GUI (Lubuntu), JVM, and Scala that students
use in the course, but excludes utilities such as text editors. The Vagrant
environment is mounts this repository at `/home/vagrant/src`. So, you can use a
text editor on the host to edit files.

# Preliminaries


    host$ vagrant up --provider virtualbox

This will take several minutes. If the `Vagrantfile` changes, you can either
manually apply the update or run

    host$ vagrant destroy

and start again.

## Building the course software

    host$ vagrant ssh
    vm$ cd src
    vm$ sbt compile

If the build succeeds, you'll be able to run the `scala220` and `check220`
scripts that students use in the course VM, in addition to an `admin220`
script that you can use to create auto-graded assignments.

## Preparing to release a software update

1. Build the "fat JARs" for the course:

       cd ~/src
       sbt assembly

2. Create the Docker image for students to sanity-check:

       cd ~/src/support-code/docker
       make

## Releasing a software update to students

We use an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive (PPA) to release software updates:

https://launchpad.net/~arjun-guha/+archive/ubuntu/umass-cs220

The Docker image is hosted on Docker Hub:

https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/arjunguha/cs220/

You'll need ask Arjun to grant you the ability to send updates. Once that's
setup, do the following:

1. Add the GPG key you use on Launchpad to `./gnupg`.

2. Add a new entry at the top of `ppa/debian/changelog`. You *have* to
   increment the version number, set a well-formatted date, and have two
   blank lines between each entry. See that file for several examples.

3. Run `cd ~/src; make ppa`.

4. Run `cd ~/support-code/docker; sudo docker.io push arjunguha/cs220`

## Creating a new course VM for students

The course VM is configured to install software from the Ubuntu PPA. If you
need to build a new course VM, ensure that the PPA is up-to-date, as described
above.

## Updating the website

Since the website is in Arjun's personal folder, you can't publish changes.
But, you can build and preview changes within the VM.

1. Run `make website`

2. Visit `http://localhost:4000` using a Web browser on your host machine.

If you can publish the website, do `cd website; publish`

## Releasing open-source software

We publish the `support-code` and `submission` directories as open source
software. To do so, we use [Subtree merging].

First time setup:

~~~
git remote add -f submission git@github.com:cmpsci220/submission.git
git remote add -f support-code git@github.com:cmpsci220/support-code.git
~~~

To push code to the open source repositories:

~~~
$ git subtree push --prefix=submission submission master
$ git subtree push --prefix=support-code support-code master
~~~

To pull code:

~~~
git fetch --all
$ git subtree pull --prefix=submission submission master
$ git subtree pull --prefix=support-code support-code master
~~~
