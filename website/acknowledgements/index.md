This course could not have come together without materials
and inspiration from many, many sources.  Many lectures, reading materials,
and homework assignments are based on these texts:

- [How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org) by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt,
  and Krishnamurthi

- [Pure Functional Data Structures](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=280586)
  by Okasaki

- [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed) by
  Oderksy, Spoon, and Venners

You should read these, even if you've taken this course.

For several assignments, we use a graphics library based on the one documented
in this article: [A Functional I/O System] by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and
Krishnamurthi.

Some of our assignments are adapted from other sources:

- The Jin Lists assignment from
  [CS19 at Brown University](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/) by Krishnamurthi, et al

- The Tic Tac Toe assignment is adapted from
  [CMPSCI383](http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/cs383/assignments/assignment03/)
  by Liberatore

- The Sudoku assignment is adapted from [Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle]
  by Norvig

Thanks to Joseph Collard and Nimish Gupta for debugging several assignments.
