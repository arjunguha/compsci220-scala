## Representations

- Picture
- Edge list
- Adjacency matrix

## Types of graphs

- Directed vs. undirected
- Edge labels
- Multigraph vs. non-multigraph

## Graphs as objects

- Object graph

## Primitive Operations

- Insert: node or edge
- Remove: node or edge
- Query: neighbors of a vertex or node

Talk about the complexity in each representation and the functional/imperative
tradeoff

## Derived Operations

- isNeighbor

## Definitions

- Path

- Reachability

- Traversal strategies (DFS, BFS)
