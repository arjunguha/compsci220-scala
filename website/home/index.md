# How to Ask Questions

Use [Piazza] for **all questions**. You can use Piazza to message the entire
class, just the course staff, or even individual staff members.

- We encourage you to post *technical questions* about the reading and homework
  publicly. This will allow both instructors and other students to respond and
  everyone will get to see the answer.

  You can post anonymously if you wish, though instructors will be able to see
  who you are. If you don't want the class to see your question at all, send it
  to *Instructors*. This is to encourage you to ask "dumb questions". (But,
  trust us: there are no dumb questions and many of your peers will have the
  same question and be grateful that you asked.)

- Send administrative questions to *Instructors* on Piazza, which includes the
  instructors, graders, and TAs. You'll get a faster response if all course
  staff can read your question.

- If you want to discuss a sensitive matter, use Piazza to contact just *Arjun
  Guha* and *Tim Richards*.

Please do not send email. We will respond with "resend to Piazza".
