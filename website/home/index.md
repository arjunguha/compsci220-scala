# Textbook

There is no required textbook. Instead, you must read the lecture notes posted on the
schedule, which includes references to other online resources when appropriate.

If you want to read a book on Scala programming, we recommend the following book:

[Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide (2nd Edition), Odersky, Spoon, Venners][textbook]
