Welcome to the {{ site.data.config.semester }} offering of COMPSCI220 Programming Methodology.

**Textbook**: There is **no required textbook**. Instead, you must read the
lecture notes posted on the schedule, which includes references to other online
resources when appropriate.

If you want to read a book on Scala programming, we recommend the following book:

[Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide (2nd Edition), Odersky, Spoon, Venners][textbook]

You must read the entire [Course Policy] document.
