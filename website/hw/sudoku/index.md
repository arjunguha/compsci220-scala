**This assignment has not been officially released. It may change completely.
If you start it early, you do so at your own risk.**

For this assignment, you will write a Sudoku solver. To do so, you will
(1) use Scala collections extensively, (2) implement a *backtracking search*
algorithm, and (3) implement *constraint propagation*.

## Preliminaries

We assume you know how to play Sudoku. If you don't, you should play a few games
by hand, before attempting this assignment.

The support code for this assignment is in the `cmpsci220.hw.sudoku` package.

You should create a series of directories that look like this:

<pre>
 ./sudoku
 |-- build.sbt
 `-- project
     `-- plugins.sbt
 `-- src
     |-- main
     |   `-- scala
     |       `-- <i>your solution goes here</i>
     `-- test
        `|-- scala
             `-- <i>your tests goes here</i>
</pre>

Your `build.sbt` file must have exactly these lines:

{% highlight scala %}
name := "sudoku"

scalaVersion := "2.11.2"

libraryDependencies += "edu.umass.cs" %% "cmpsci220" % "1.8"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.2.1" % "test"
{% endhighlight %}

The `plugins.sbt` file must have exactly this line:

{% highlight scala %}
addSbtPlugin("edu.umass.cs" % "cmpsci220" % "2.2")
{% endhighlight %}

## Overview

A Sudoku board is a 9-by-9 grid, where each cell is either blank or has a value
in the range 1--9. For this assignment, we'll use strings of length 81 to
represent Sudoku boards, where each block of nine characters represents a
successive row. For example, the following string:

    val puzzle = "....8.3...6..7..84.3.5..2.9...1.54.8.........4.27.6...3.1..7.4.72..4..6...4.1...3"

Represents the following board:

       | 8 |3
     6 | 7 | 84
     3 |5  |2 9
    ---+---+---
       |1 5|4 8
       |   |
    4 2|7 6|
    ---+---+---
    3 1|  7| 4
    72 | 4 | 6
      4| 1 |  3

Here are some more examples:

    ".43.8.25.6.............1.949....4.7....6.8....1.2....382.5.............5.34.9.71."
    "2...8.3...6..7..84.3.5..2.9...1.54.8.........4.27.6...3.1..7.4.72..4..6...4.1...3"
    "..3.2.6..9..3.5..1..18.64....81.29..7.......8..67.82....26.95..8..2.3..9..5.1.3.."
    "1..92....524.1...........7..5...81.2.........4.27...9..6...........3.945....71..6"

Your first task is to parse strings that represent Sudoku boards. You may
assume that all strings represent solvable boards and that the string has
exactly 81 characters. This part of the assignment should be trivial.

Solving Sudoku puzzles is much harder, but we'll walk you through it.

*Backtracking search* is a recursive algorithm that operates as follows. Given a
a Sudoku board, *B*:

- If *B* is already filled completely and a solution, return the solution.
- If *B* is an invalid board (e.g., two 2s in a row), abort.
- Otherwise, generate a list of all boards that fill in one more square of
  *B*. For each generated board, recursively apply the search function:
  - If any board produces a valid solution, return that board
  - If no board produces a solution, abort and return

This approach will work in principle. But, in practice there are too many boards
to search: there are 81 squares, and each square can hold 10 values (a digit or
blank). Therefore, there are 10^81 possible boards, which exceeds the
[number of atoms in the observable universe].

To actually solve Sudoku problems, we need to combine backtracking search with
*constraint propogation*. When you play Sudoku yourself, every time you fill a
digit into a cell, you can eliminate that digit from several other cells. For
example, if you fill 2 into the top-left corner of the board above, you can
eliminate 2 from the first row, first column, and first box. i.e., there is no
point even trying to place 2 in those spots, since the 2 in the corner
*constrains* those cells.

We'll augment backtracking search with constraint propagation, which
implements this intuition. The key idea is to store not the value at a cell, but
the *set of values* that may be placed in a cell. For example, on
the empty board the values 1---9 may be placed at any cell:

    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    ------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    ------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789

With this representation, when we place a value at a cell, we eliminate it from
the other cells in the same row, column, and box (collectively known as the
*peers* of a cell). For example, if we place 5 at the top-left corner of the
empty board, we can elimiate 5 from the peers of the top-left corner:

        5     1234 6789 1234 6789 | 1234 6789 1234 6789 1234 6789 | 1234 6789 1234 6789 1234 6789
    1234 6789 1234 6789 1234 6789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    1234 6789 1234 6789 1234 6789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    ------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    ------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789
    1234 6789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789 | 123456789 123456789 123456789

This procedure will significantly reduce the number of boards that need to be visited.

## Programming Task

Your task is to implement the `SolutionLike` and `BoardLike` traits.
You can use the following template.

{% highlight scala %}
import cmpsci220.hw.sudoku._

object Solution extends SudokuLike {
  type T = Board

  def parse(str: String): Board = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  // You can use a Set instead of a List (or, any Iterable)
  def peers(row: Int, col: Int): List[(Int, Int)] = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }
}

// Top-left corner is (0,0). Bottom-right corner is (8,8).
// You don't have to have a field called available. Feel free to change it.
class Board(val available: Map[(Int, Int), List[Int]]) extends BoardLike[Board] {

  def availableValuesAt(row: Int, col: Int): List[Int] = {
    // Assumes that a missing value means all values are available. Feel
    // free to change this.
    available.getOrElse((row, col), 1.to(9).toSet)
  }

  def valueAt(row: Int, col: Int): Option[Int] = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  def isSolved(): Boolean = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  def isUnsolvable(): Boolean = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  def place(row: Int, col: Int, value: Int): T = {
    require(availableValuesAt(row, col).contains(value))
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  // You can return any Iterable (e.g., Stream)
  def nextStates(): List[T] = {
    if (isUnsolvable()) {
      return List()
    }

    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }

  def solve(): Option[T] = {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("not implemented")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We recomend proceeding in this order and testing as you go along:

1. Implement `Solution.peers`. `peers(r, c)` produces the coordinates of all
   cells in the same row as `r`, same column as `c`, and same block as `(r,c)`.

2. Implement `Solution.parse` You  should assume that the input string is
   matches the regular expression `"""(\.|[1-9]){81}""".r` and that
   each block of nine characters represents a row (i.e., row-major order).

   As the template suggests, you need to store the set of available values at
   each cell instead of the value at the cell. You'll need to define
   the empty board as the map with all values available at each cell and
   implement `parse` using `peers` as a helper function.

3. Implement `Board.valueAt`. You should produce the digit stored at the
   given row and column or `None` if it is blank.

4. Implement `Board.isSolved` and `Board.isSolvable`. You may assume
   that the constraints represented by `available` are valid. Therefore, a board
   is solved if every cell is constrained to exactly one value. Similarly,
   a board is unsolvable if any cell is constrained to the empty set of values
   (i.e., nothing can be placed in that cell).

5. Implement `Board.place`. `place(row, col, value)` produces a new board with
   `value` placed at `(row, col)` of `this` board.  You may assume that
   `availableValuesAt(row, col).contains(value)` is true.

   For the new board to be valid, you'll have to:

   1. Remove `value` from set of available values of each peer
      (i.e., `peers(row, col)`).
   2. While doing (1), if a peer is constrained to exactly 1 value, remove
      that value from its peers.

6. Implement `nextStates`, which returns the list of all boards that have
   exactly one additional value placed on the board.

   You should sort the returned list: ensure that boards with fewer available
   values occur earier in the list.

7. Implement `solve`. If `this.isSolution` is true, then return `Some(this)`.
   If not, iterate through the list of `nextStates`, applying `solve` to
   board. Return the first solution that you find. If no solution is found,
   return `None`.

## Solvable Boards

Your solver will not be able to solve arbitrary Sudoku boards. But,
here are some boards that should work:

{% highlight scala %}
val fromCS121_1 = "85....4.1......67...21....3..85....7...982...3....15..5....43...37......2.9....58"
val fromCS121_2 = ".1.....2..3..9..1656..7...33.7..8..........89....6......6.254..9.5..1..7..3.....2"
val puz1 = ".43.8.25.6.............1.949....4.7....6.8....1.2....382.5.............5.34.9.71."
val puz2 = "2...8.3...6..7..84.3.5..2.9...1.54.8.........4.27.6...3.1..7.4.72..4..6...4.1...3"
{% endhighlight %}

There are several sources of Sudoku puzzles on the Web. Here are 50
purportedly easy puzzles:

[http://norvig.com/easy50.txt](http://norvig.com/easy50.txt)

You can use this terminal command to translate them into the format for this assignment:

    curl -s http://norvig.com/easy50.txt | tr '\n' ' ' | tr '0' '.' | sed 's/ //' | sed 's/ ======== /\'$'\n/g'

**In addition, I encourage you to share solvable puzzles with each other on Piazza.**

## Check Your Work

Here is a trivial test suite that simply checks to see if you've defined
the `Solution` object with the right type:

{% highlight scala %}
class TrivialTestSuite extends org.scalatest.FunSuite {

  test("The solution object must be defined") {
    val obj : cmpsci220.hw.sudoku.SudokuLike = Solution
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You should place this test suite in `src/test/scala/TrivialTestSuite.scala`.
If this test suite does not run as-is, you risk getting a zero.

## Submit Your Work

Use the `submit` command within `sbt` to create `submission.tar.gz`. Upload
this file to Moodle.
