For this homework, we're going to be working with graphs and algorithms for
finding paths through them. Graphs are represented as lists of Nodes (the
vertices of the graphs) and Edges (3-tuples that contain the source node, the
destination node, and the distance between them).

**We provide overviews of the graph algorithms below. We strongly suggest
research these algorithms on your own for additional information.** (Wikipedia
is a great resource for this!)

## Part 0: Importing

We'll be using a library called "edgegraph" for this.

{% highlight scala %}
import edgegraph.\_
{% endhighlight %}

It consists of the Graph package (defines Node and Edge), EdgeGraph (defines the
actual graph representation) and util (contains the minMember function, discussed
below). There's also the TestGraphs package, which contains sample graphs for
you to test your functions on.

You should configure your sbt file accordingly.

## Part 1: Depth-first Search: Reachability

The basic depth-first search (DFS) algorithm takes some graph *G* and a starting
node *v*, then does the following:

1. Label *v* as discovered
2. Find all nodes that are adjacent to *v*
3. For all adjacent nodes *w* that are undiscovered, recusively call DFS(*G*, *w*)

There's also a way to do it iteratively instead of recursively:

1. Push *v* to a stack *S*
2. If *S* is empty, we're done iterating
3. Otherwise, pop the top element off the stack. We'll call it *w*
4. If *w* is not marked as visited, mark it and push all nodes adjacent to *w*
   onto the stack.
5. If *w* has already been visited, ignore it and iterate.

DFS requires some way to mark the nodes of the graph *G*, which is usually done
with some field in the node or a global list of discovered nodes. We can't use
the first way because our nodes are just Ints. The second way requires a list
that is accessible to all of the calls to DFS, which is definitely doable. A
normal Scala List can be used, but a Set makes more sense.

The DFS algorithm returns the list of visited nodes. This is called the set of
*reachable nodes* from the starting node *v*.

Write the function reachable() that performs a depth-first search from a given
node:

{% highlight scala %}
def reachable(graph: EdgeGraph, start: Graph.Node): Set[Graph.Node]
{% endhighlight %}

You may do this recursively (by writing a helper function) or iteratively.

## Part 2: Depth-first Search: Paths

You'll notice that reachable() doesn't actually tell us the path from one node
to another. To do that, we need to modify our code and keep track of which nodes
are reachable from each other.

We need some way to keep track of which nodes are next to each other. If we have
a graph where 0 (our starting node) is connected to 1 and 2, and 2 is connected
to 3:

<pre>
0 --> 1
|     |
v     v
2     3
</pre>

Then our path from 0 to 3 is (0 -> 1 -> 3). DFS will start at 0, then process 1,
then 3, then back up to 2. To keep track of the path, we can map the
*destination* node to the *previous* node. For this graph:

0 -> -1 (There's no node before 0, so we give it the "no node" index)
1 -> 0
2 -> 0
3 -> 1

Since our Nodes are just Ints, we can use a Scala Array or List, where the
index is the destination and the value at that index is the "previous" node.
This list should have an entry for every node in the graph, even if it isn't
reached. Unreached nodes will have -1 as their previous node. A node should have
its entry in the list filled only if it isn't already marked. That is, if we
previously found that 3 is reachable through 1, and 3 is also reachable by 2,
3's entry should *not* be updated.

Modify the code of reachable() to create dfsPath(), which takes an EdgeGraph and
a start node. It should return an Array[Graph.Node], which contains the list of
nodes that are adjacent to each other, as described above.

{% highlight scala %}
def dfsPath(graph: EdgeGraph, start: Graph.Node): Array[Graph.Node]
{% endhighlight %}

*Hints:*
- *You **cannot** solve this by calling your previous DFS function. But you can easily
adapt it to solve this problem.*
- *Scala Arrays are mutable. This means if you have an Array[Int] arr, arr(i) =
  j will update the array. You still declare Arrays with **val**.*

### Optional: Breadth-First Search (Read it anyway)

Unfortunately, the DFS algorithm is not guaranteed to find the shortest path in
the graph. We could instead use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which
is guaranteed to do so. Because this section is optional, you should look up how
BFS differs from DFS on your own.

Your implementation of DFS can easily be converted to BFS by using a queue
instead of a stack to track nodes to check. Scala's Queue type doesn't
follow the same conventions as List, so you'll have to change a bit more code to
get it to work. Try it out by implementing `bfsPath()` using a queue. You'll
have to import scala.collection.immutable.Queue.

{% highlight scala %}
def bfsPath(graph: EdgeGraph, start: Graph.Node): Array[Graph.Node]
{% endhighlight %}

Do note that BFS finds the shortest path *in terms of nodes to traverse*.
In the next section, we'll talk about another algorithm for finding a path in a
graph. Unlike DFS, it's designed to find the shortest path. Unlike BFS, it cares
about the *distance between nodes*.

## Part 3: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Previously, I mentioned that the Edges in our graph contain the distance between
the two nodes. The DFS algorithm will find us any path from start to finish. The
optional BFS algorithm will find the path from start to finish with the fewest
number of nodes. **GO READ THE OPTIONAL SECTION IF YOU HAVEN'T YET.**

With this next algorithm, we'll take the edge distance into account and find the
shortest path to each node in terms of distance.

Dijkstra's Algorithm was invented, perhaps unsurprisingly, by Edsger Dijkstra, a
Dutch computer scientist. He's a fascinating figure and really quite important
to the history of the field. The algorithm takes a weighted graph and finds the
shortest path from a starting to every other node, though it can be easily
adapted to find the path to a target node. It tracks the distance between a node
and the starting node and which nodes are closest together.

The steps of the algorithm are fairly simple, but there's a bit of set up.
As usual, we start with a graph *G* and a starting node *v*.

*Setup:*
1. Assign every node a tentative initial distance
    - For the initial node, the distance is 0
    - For every other node it is infinity (or some arbitrarily high value)
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited
3. Create a set of all unvisited nodes, which will be processed during the
   algorithm. This initially contains all of the nodes.
*Algorithm:*
4. Select the unvisited node that has the smallest tentative distance and use it
   as the next current node.
5. For the current node *v*: For each neighbor *w*, calculate the tentative
   distance. If this is smaller than the current distance, store it.
    - Tentative distance = distance of *v* + length from *v* to *w*
6. Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.
   Iterate.

Implement the function dijkstra(), which finds the shortest path through the
graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Like dfsPath() above, it should return an array
of nodes with the "previous" node. Unlike dfsPath(), this actually tracks which
node creates the shortest path to the current node. This means the value may be
updated if a previous node has already been filled in.

{% highlight scala %}
def dijkstra(graph: EdgeGraph, start: Graph.Node): Array[Graph.Node]
{% endhighlight %}

Some hints:

- As before, we can use a set to track the unvisited nodes.
- The distance to each node can be stored in an array. The indices of the array
  are the nodes and the values are the distance, similar to the "previous node"
  array.
- Often, a priority queue is used instead of a set. This adds unnecessary
  complexity, since Scala doesn't have the necessary features in its
  PriorityQueue class.
- For step 6, we provide a function called minMember() in the util package. This
  takes an array of values (e.g. the distances) and a set of integers (e.g. the
  set of unvisited nodes) and returns the member of the set that corresponds to
  the lowest value.
- If you wish to use a Priority Queue instead, you will have to implement a way
  to reduce the priority of an item in order to reflect the updated distance.
  Just use minMember().
- You don't have to use infinity for the initial distance. Something like 10000
  will be more than enough. (The graphs won't be THAT big!)
- You can definitely do this recursively!

## Part 4: Evaluating the Paths

The DFS algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm return the same thing: a list of
nodes that form a path through the graph. That means we can write functions to
evaluate both algorithms.

First, we need a function that will take the adjacency list produced by the
algorithms and find the path from the start node to the end node. We can do this
by walking backwards from the destination node up the adjacency list to the
start node. Remember that the start node has the value "-1" in the adjacency
list, so we can use that as signal that the path is complete.

Write the function makePath() to perform this operation:

{% highlight scala %}
def makePath(adj: Array[Graph.Node], end: Graph.Node): List[Graph.Node]
{% endhighlight %}

Second, let's make a function that checks if a path is valid. A path is valid if
there is an edge between each consecutive node:

<pre>
0 --> 1 --> 3
|           |
v           v
2 --> 4     5
</pre>

makePath(dfs(graph, 0), 5) would return List(0,1,3,5). isValidPath should check
the edges between the nodes to make sure this is a valid path. If, for example,
we checked the path (0,2,3,5), isValidPath would return false because there is
no path between 2 and 3. A path with only one node is still a valid path.

Write the function isValidPath() that checks path correctness:

{% highlight scala %}
def isValidPath(graph: EdgeGraph, path: List[Graph.Node]): Boolean
{% endhighlight %}

*Note: A path of length one (e.g. path = List(0)) is a valid path.*

Finally, we should make a function that finds the length of a path. The
EdgeGraph has a function that finds the distance between two nodes, if there is
an edge from the first to the second. If no edge exists, it returns *None*. You
can assume that every path passed into this function is valid. A path with a
single node has length 0.

Write the function pathLength() that finds the length of a path:

{% highlight scala %}
def pathLength(graph: EdgeGraph, path: List[Graph.Node]): Int
{% endhighlight %}

## Check Your Work

The TestGraph package contains a few sample graphs that will help you test your
functions. These also include the lengths of certain paths for you to compare
against your DFS and Dijkstra's Algorithm paths. Use these to write several
tests for both path-finding algorithms and the path-checking functions.
