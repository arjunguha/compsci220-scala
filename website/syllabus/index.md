## Description

Development of individual skills necessary for designing, implementing,
testing and modifying larger programs, including: use of integrated design
environments, design strategies and patterns, testing, working with large code
bases and libraries, code refactoring, and use of debuggers and tools for
version control.

## Textbooks

The following textbook is required:

[Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide (2nd Edition), Odersky, Spoon, Venners][textbook]

We will supplement this textbook with other reading material that is available
online.

## Course Objectives

**TODO: A list of objectives to be filled in.**

## Course Assessment

Student knowledge of the course will be assessed from a variety of angles
including:

* Programming Assignments
* Quizzes
* Participation
* Final Exam

### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments are intensive programming assignments (in Scala) that
exercise your understanding of the material through the application of
programming concepts and techniques. There will be weekly programming
assignments throughout the semester. Programming assignments are an
important component of this course and will take the most time to complete as
compared to other assessment parts. You should give yourself plenty of time to
complete a project assignment. Programming assignments must be completed
independently.

### Quizzes, Participation, Etc.

Quizzes are used to assess your understanding of the concepts covered during
lecture and readings. They will typically consist of 5-10 multiple choice and
true/false style questions that will help keep you on track with the course
throughout the semester. Quizzes will be given and submitted electronically
through [Moodle][moodle]. The exact number of quizzes will be determined as
the course progresses. Your participation will be evaluated through in class
exercises, discussion attendance, and interaction in the online Piazza
discussion forum. [Piazza] records statistics about your activity such as the
number of times you logged into the system, how many posts you read, how many
posts you responded to, and how many new posts you created. We will evaluate
the participation on Piazza at the end of the semester.

## Exams

There will be midterm and final exam. They will consist of multiple choice,
true/false, short answer style questions as well as some open response
questions that will typically require writing or analyzing Scala code. The
exams will be given online using the Moodle quiz component. The exams will be
based on the material covered up to that point. The exams will be open book
and notes and will be timed. You will be required to work individually.

## Grading

The final grade for this course will be based on the following assessment
components:

 Component             | Percentage
-----------------------|------------------------:
Project Assignments    | 60%
Quizzes                | 15%
Participation          | 5%
Final exam             | 20%
**Total**              | **100%**

## Final Grades

The primary goal of a final letter grade is to convey your overall
understanding of the course material. To determine your overall
understanding of the course content we will use scores on each of the
above assessment components as well as your overall performance in the
course. This includes a careful observation of low scores that are not
indicative of your true performance as well as missed assignments. For
example, if you score low on a single assignment or exam this may be
weighted lower than other exams or if you miss several quizzes or
assignments your final grade will reflect this. In general, your final
grade will convey what you did in the course and how well you did it.
Missing and late assignments can have a dramatic impact on your final
grade so it is important that you are attentive to submission
deadlines and avoid any missing work.  The typical breakdown of
percentages and final grades for this course are A (93-100), A-
(90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-
(70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), F (0-59). This grading scheme may be
adjusted based on the overall performance of students in the course.

Your grades for each assessment component will be available in the
[Moodle][moodle] Gradebook. It is your responsibility to monitor your grades
and progress in the course by visiting the [Moodle site][moodle]. If you are
having problems in the course you should post questions to the online
discussion forum, visit office hours, or contact the instructors or one of the
TA's immediately for extra help. Do not wait until the last minute to
request help. It is important for you to pay attention to your progress to
be successful in this course.

## Attendance, Participation, & Late Work

You should attend every lecture and discussion section. If you miss a lecture
or workshop, talk to a friend who was present, and check the course website
for course announcements and schedule. Your participation in class is an
important contribution to the success of this course. You are responsible for
asking questions, offering comments, and completing any in-class exercises.
You will not be graded directly on your attendance and participation but it
can have a positive or negative influence on your final grade for the course.
If you miss a workshop you do have the opportunity of completing the workshop
exercise outside of class and submitting.

### Lateness Policy

You should make every effort to submit your assignments, quizzes, and
exams by the assigned due date. At the same time, we understand that
life happens and other events can cause your assignments to be
submitted late such as illness, deaths, accidents, forgetfulness,
laziness, organization, etc. For this reason we provide you with four
free late days that you may use at any point during the course. We
will monitor your use of late days and apply late penalties during the
final grading process for any days that exceed the four free late
days. A late day starts immediately after the assigned date and time
and continues for 24 hours after that time. If you exceed your four
free late days your final grade will be penalized. Because it is
possible for some assignments to rely on the solutions of previous
assignments we may not allow late days to be spent. The final
assignment will also not allow late days to be used as the final
grading process will need to be completed in a timely manner.

### Assignment Submission

Assignments will be submitted electronically to Moodle. You are
responsible for submitting your assignments by the assigned due date.
Assignments will typically be due on the same day and time each week
throughout the course.

## Teaching Assistants, Help, & Accommodations

There will be a TA that will be working with the instructor in this
course to ensure success! The responsibilities of the TAs include
writing and releasing quizzes, ensuring assignments are graded in
a timely manner, holding office hours, and answering questions in the
online discussion forums provided by the Piazza environment. If you
require help during the semester please do not wait to contact a TA,
meet them during their office hours, and communicate to ensure your
success in this course.

If you require any special services or accommodations during this
course please make sure you register with Disability Services **within
the first two weeks** of this course. This will give us time to plan
accordingly to ensure that you get the help you need before it is too
late. If you contact us after the two weeks we may not be able to
provide you the help you need.

## Office Hours and Communication

The course staff will be available during scheduled office hours. We try to
restrict our office hour visits to 20 minutes so that (1) we can try to meet
with as many students as possible during office hours and (2) it helps focus
your visit.  You should be prepared when you come to office hours with any
examples or questions immediately available.  Please do not expect to sit in
office hours and fix an assignment in front of us while we answer your
questions - this means you can't code in front of us unless we explicitly ask
you to do so. If you have questions you should post them to Piazza
immediately. This will get you answers to your questions faster than sending
individual emails. In addition, it is highly likely that there are other
students in the course who have the same question or quite possibly an answer
to your question! **We highly encourage you to take advantage of this medium
of communication**. The discussion forum will also be used as part of our final
grading process, so it favorable for you to participate.

## Academic Dishonesty

All submitted work **must be your own**. Although students may study
together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution
to the assignment problems. You may not collaborate with each other on
exams. We encourage you to discuss assignment problems with others in
this course, however, your writing (including code) of solutions must
be your own. A good rule of thumb during a discussion of assignment
exercises is to leave behind all computing devices, writing
implements, paper, and any other material that could be used to record
thoughts and ideas. Using a whiteboard is acceptable, however, all
thoughts and ideas should be **erased** before leaving the room and should
not persist in any form. This will ensure your solutions to be
recorded in isolation and submitted without worry. You should record
as part of your submission those individuals you collaborated with
during a discussion - this will help protect you if academic dishonesty
is suspected. Any outside material including online resources that you
used to develop a solution must be recorded as part of your
submission. Of course, copying any material directly or indirectly
from the web is considered dishonest and is **much easier than you think
for us to detect**, so *don't do it*!

When in doubt, contact the instructor about whether a potential action would
be considered plagiarism. Copying or using sections of someone else’s program
or assignment, even if it has been modified by you, is not acceptable. The
University has very clear guidelines for academic misconduct and the TA and
instructor of this course will be vigorous in enforcing them. Please see the
[UMass policy on academic honesty][conduct] if you need clarification.
