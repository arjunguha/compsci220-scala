This page has links to all course content, but is not shared with the students
in the class. It is not a big deal if students see this page, but keeping it
confidential will give us more flexibility.

## Piazza duty

Spend up to 1 hour per day on Piazza. You should check it in dedicate blocks of
time, instead of checking it continuously all day. (E.g., you could check it for
30 mins in the morning and 30 mins in the evening, at a time when you aren't
particularly productive.)
