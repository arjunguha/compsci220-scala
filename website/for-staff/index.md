This page has links to all course content, but is not shared with the students
in the class. It is not a big deal if students see this page, but keeping it
confidential will give us more flexibility.

## Instructor Manual

This has all lectures, homework assignments, notes for instructors, etc.
Some of the stuff toward the end is really rough.

## Piazza duty

- Spend up to 1 hour per day on Piazza. You should check it in dedicate blocks of
time, instead of checking it continuously all day. (E.g., you could check it for
30 mins in the morning and 30 mins in the evening, at a time when you aren't
particularly productive.)

- Try to kill off duplicate threads
