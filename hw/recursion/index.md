FILL: No attempt to make this fun. Just lots of exercises writing recursive
programs over lists and trees. Extra credit: functional tree update.

# Overview

The goal of this assignment is to exercise your understanding of
generics, recursion, and higher-order functions. Each of these
represent important patterns in programming. Generics is a programming
paradigm for building efficient and reusable software libraries (e.g.,
collections). Recursion is a programming pattern that solves a problem
by solving smaller instances of that problem. Higher-order functions
allow for flexible programming and implement the *command* and
*strategy* patterns typically found in object-oriented languages.
