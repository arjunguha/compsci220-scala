\begin{instructor}

\section*{Lecture Outline}

\begin{itemize}

\item Password strength: at least three letters

\begin{verbatim}
.*[A-Z].*[A-Z].*[A-Z].*
\end{verbatim}

At least two numbers:

\begin{verbatim}
.*[0-9].*[0-9].*
\end{verbatim}

Three letters and two numbers:

\item Grouping (e.g., dates):

\begin{scalacode}
    val date = """(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)""".r
    "2004-01-20" match {
      case date(year, month, day) => year + " was a good year for PLs."
    }
\end{scalacode}

\item Replacement:

\begin{scalacode}
"Jan|January".r.replaceAllIn(str, "01")
\end{scalacode}

\item Reduce derived regular expressions to a core using identities

\item Show regular expressions as an ADT

\item Write a back-tracking matcher

\item Write a string generator for regular expressions using streams

\item An implementation of memoizing regular expression derivates in includes/regex-derivatives

\end{itemize}
