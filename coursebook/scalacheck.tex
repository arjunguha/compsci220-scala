\chapter{Lecture: Property-Based Testing}


\begin{instructor}

\textbf{Old notes are on the website incorporate them somehow.}

\section*{Lecture Outline}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Sometimes, writing individual test cases isn't enough or isn't desirable.
It can help to think of properties instead of test cases.

\item Write some list processing functions: reverse, concat, map

\item Some properties of list processing functions: reverse and concat,
concat distributes over map, reverse reverse is identity

\item Write a tail recursive fibonnaci and check that the two implementations
are equivalent

\item Write properties of join lists

\end{enumerate}
