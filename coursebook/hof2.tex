\section*{Lecture Outline}

\begin{itemize}

\item Example functions: \lstinline|sum|, \lstinline|product|, \lstinline|concat|. Abstract their differences. 

\item Write \lstinline|fold| without annotations, then reason through the types.

\item Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions (already seen examples).

\item Functions can be nested within other functions (e.g., nest the little helper functions).

\item Functions can produce functions (\lstinline|makeAdder|).

\item Functions do not need to be named. \lstinline|def| is sugar for
  \lstinline|val|. Refactor \lstinline|makeAdder| and show anonymous
  functions used with higher-order functions.

\item Functions can be stored in data structures:
  \lstinline|case class Foo(m1: Int => Int, m2: Int => Int)|.

\item Define \emph{higher-order function} and \emph{first-class function}.

\item Example of scope:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def f(x: Int): Int = {
    val y = x + 10
    y
  }
  f(11)
  y
  \end{scalacode}

\item Example of shadowing: reason through it by
  substitution. \emph{Every line is a Scala program}

\item Object-oriented programming:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(
  getX: () => Double,
  getY: () => Double,
  mag: () => Double,
  add => Point => Point)

def makePoint(x: Double, y: Double): Point = ...
\end{scalacode}

\section{Folding\classtime{20}}
%
The four functions in \cref{folding_prototypes} are examples of
\emph{folding functions}. A folding function ``collapses'' a list into
a single value. A fold is characterized by a binary operation used to
combine values and a base case for the empty list.

\begin{itemize}

\item In \scalainline{sum}, the binary operation is \scalainline{+}
and the base value is \scalainline{0}:
\begin{scalacode}
sum(List(10, 20, 30)) = 10 + (20 + (30 + 0))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{product}, the binary operation is \scalainline{*}
and the base value is \scalainline{1}:
\begin{scalacode}
product(List(2, 3, 4)) = 2 * (3 + (4 * 1))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{concat}, the binary operation is \scalainline{+} (string
concatenation) and the base value is \scalainline{""}:
\begin{scalacode}
concat(List("X", "Y", "Z")) = "X" + ("Y" + ("Z" + ""))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{totalLen}, the binary operation is the following
function:
\begin{scalacode}
def binop (hd : String, tailLen : Int) : int = hd.length + tailLen
\end{scalacode}
and the base value is \scalainline{0}:
\begin{scalacode}
totalLen(List("hi", "cs220", "student")) = binop("hi", binop("cs220", binop("student" 0)))
\end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

Now that we've seen the common pattern, it's clear that we abstract
these functions to a higher-order
function that takes three arguments (1) the original list, (2)
a two-argument function instead of a fixed binary operator, and (3) a
value for the base-case, instead of a fixed base-case:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def fold(baseCase: ???, binOp: (???, ???) => ???, alist: List[???]): ??? = alist match {
  case Nil => baseCase
  case head :: tail => binOp(head, fold(baseCase, binOp, tail))
}
\end{scalacode}

We can rewrite the functions in \cref{folding_prototypes} more
succinctly as follows:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def sum(alist : List[Int]) = fold(0, (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y, alist)

def product(alist : List[Int]) = fold(1, (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y, alist)

def concat(alist : List[String]) = fold("", (x: String, y: String) => x + y, alist)

// binOp was defined above
def totalLen(alist : List[Int]) = fold(0, binOp, alist)
\end{scalacode}

Note that in \scalainline{binOp}, the types of the two arguments
are different. The type of the first argument is the same as the
type of the elements in the list. The type of the second argument
is the same as the type of the result of the function. This is because
when \scalainline{binOp} is applied (internally within \scalainline{fold}),
the first argument to  \scalainline{binOp} is an element of the
list, and the second argument is an intermediate result.
Therefore, we can fill in the types in \scalainline{fold} as follows:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def fold[A,B](baseCase: B, binOp: (A, B) => B, alist: List[A]): B = alist match {
  case Nil => baseCase
  case head :: tail => binOp(head, fold(baseCase, binOp, tail))
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Functions are Values\classtime{10}}

\paragraph{Functions can be passed as arguments to functions.}
The last lecture introduced functions can be passed as arguments
to other functions. For example, the function \scalainline{filter(f, alist)}
produces a list of all the items of \scalainline{alist} for which \scalainline{f}
is \scalainline{true}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def filter[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[Int]): List[A] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case Cons(head, tail) =>
    f(head) match {
      case true => head :: filter(f, tail)
      case false => filter(f, tail)
    }
}
\end{scalacode}

This allowed us to write several functions very easily, for example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def isEven(n: Int): Boolean = n % 2 == 0

def onlyEvens(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  filter(isEven, alist)
}

def nonZero(n: Int): Boolean = n != 0

def onlyNonZero(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  filter(nonZero, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}

\paragraph{Functions can be nested within other functions.}

If our goal was to write the list-processing functions, then the
functions \scalainline{isEven} and \scalainline{nonZero}, are
cluttering our code. Another programmer may think that they are signficant,
although they simply exist as trivial helper functions.

Functions can be nested within other functions:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def onlyEvens(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  def isEven(n: Int): Boolean = n % 2 == 0
  filter(isEven, alist)
}

def onlyNonZero(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  def nonZero(n: Int): Boolean = n != 0
  filter(nonZero, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}
%
In particular, the names \scalainline{isEven} and \scalainline{nonZero}
are \emph{not defined} outside their respective functions.

\paragraph{Functions can produce functions.}

Functions can also produce other functions. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = {
  def addX(y: Int): Int = x + y
  addX(x)
}

val addThree = makeAdder(3)
test("add3 test") {
  assert(addThree(10) == 13)
}
\end{scalacode}

\paragraph{Functions do not need to be named.}

Unlike other values, functions seem to have the following special property:
every function has a name, but the other kinds of values do not.
For example, we can simply write \scalainline{1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil}
and don't need to give this list a name. So far, all of the functions we've seen
start with \scalainline{def functionName}.

It turns out that this is just a convention. As with other values,
functions don't need names. For example, here is a function that adds two
numbers:

\begin{scalacode}
((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)
\end{scalacode}

This function does not have a name, but it can be applied just like
any other function:

\begin{scalacode}
((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)(10, 20)
\end{scalacode}

The code above is not easy to read. It will be a lot clearer of we give the
function a name. You already know how to name a function using \scalainline{def}. But, all
other values are named using \scalainline{val}. In fact, we can use \scalainline{val} to name functions
too, just like any other type of value:

\begin{scalacode}
val adder = ((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)

adder(10, 20)
\end{scalacode}

You should think of \scalainline{def} as a convenient shorthand for naming functions.
That is, these two definitions are equivalent:

\begin{scalacode}
val adder = ((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)

def adder(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
\end{scalacode}

In general, it is a good idea to name your functions. But, there are
certain situations where a short, anonymous function can make your code
easier to read and write.

For example, we earlier defined the \scalainline{doubleAll} function, which doubles
every number in a list of numbers. Here is simple, one-line definition
using an anonymous function as an argument to \scalainline{map}:

\begin{scalacode}
def doubleAll(alist: List[Int]) = map((n: Int) => n * 2, alist)
\end{scalacode}

The anonymous function itself is extremely simple and the name of the enclosing
function, \scalainline{doubleAll}, really makes it clear what it does.

For another example, suppose we want to remove all the odd numbers
in a list. We can do this using \scalainline{filter} and a short, anonymous function:

\begin{scalacode}
def removeOdds(alist: List[Int]) = filter((n: Int) => n % 2 == 0, alist)
\end{scalacode}

In these kinds of situations, anonymous functions can be very helpful.

\paragraph{Functions can be stored in data structures.}

The following datatype can stores two functions inside it:
%
\begin{scalacode}
case class Foo(m1: Int => Int, m2: Int => Int)
\end{scalacode}

We can create values of type \scalainline{Foo} in the following way:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val myFoo = Foo((x: Int) => x + 1, (y: Int) => y * 20)

assert(myFoo.m1(10) == 11)
assert(myFoo.m2(10) == 200)
\end{scalacode}
%
Admittedly, this isn't very useful, but notice that the function applications
look a lot like method calls.

\subsection{Some Definitions}

Here are some terminology that gets thrown around when comparing programming
languages and programming techniques.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Higher-order functions} are functions that consume or return other
  functions as values. You can tell if a function is higher-order by inspecting
  its type. Does it have any nested uses of \scalainline{=>} in the type? If so, it is a higher-order
  function.

  \item \emph{First-class functions} is a property of a programming language. For
  a programming language to have first-class functions, it must treat functions
  as values, with all the rights and privileges that other values have. You must
  be able to use functions as arguments, produce functions as results, and store
  functions in data-structures.

\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and Substitution\classtime{20}}

\paragraph{Global vs. Local Variables}

Why does the following program raise an error?

%
\begin{scalacode}
def f(x: Int) = {
  val y = x + 10
  y
}
f(11)
y
\end{scalacode}

Although the program defines a variable called \scalainline{y}, the
\emph{scope} of the variable is limited to the function \scalainline{f}.
Therefore, we cannot refer to the variable outside the function, which
is why we get an error.

\paragraph{Substitution}

What does the following program produce?
%
\begin{scalacode}
val x = 20
def f(x: Int): Int = {
  x + 5
}
f(10) + x
\end{scalacode}

The result is \scalainline{35}. Within the body of \scalainline{f}, the
the name \scalainline{x} refers to the argument to the function, which
\emph{shadows} the global variable \scalainline{val x = 20}. Therefore,
\scalainline{f(10) == 15}. However, outside the function \scalainline{x}
refers to the global variable \scalainline{x == 20}, and
\scalainline{15 + 20 == 35}.

We can make this argument more precise by \emph{substituting} variables
with their values:

\begin{itemize}

\item Given the orignal program above, we first substitute
the global \scalainline{x} with its value \scalainline{20}, to get
the following program:
\begin{scalacode}
def f(x: Int): Int = {
  x + 5
}
f(10) + 20
\end{scalacode}
%
Notice that we substituted the \scalainline{x} on the last line with \scalainline{20},
but left the \scalainline{x} within \scalainline{f} unchanged, since it referred
to the argument \scalainline{x}.

\item Next, we can apply the function \scalainline{f} by substituting
its argument \scalainline{x} with the value \scalainline{10}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
(10 + 5) + 20
\end{scalacode}

\item Finally, we are left with a simple arithmetic expression that is
trivial to evaluate.

\end{itemize}

Here is a more compact way of making the same argument:
%
\[
\small
\begin{array}{l|l|l}
 & \textrm{Expression} & \textrm{Reasoning} \\
\hline
& \lstinline[language=scala]|val x = 20; def f(x: Int): Int = { x + 5 }; f(10) + x|
& \textrm{Original expression} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|def f(x: Int): Int = { x + 5 }; f(10) + 20|
& \textrm{Substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|x| with \lstinline[language=scala]|20|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|(10 + 5) + 20|
& \textrm{Inline \lstinline[language=scala]|f| and substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|x| with \lstinline[language=scala]|10|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|15 + 20|
& \textrm{Evaluate \lstinline[language=scala]|10 + 5|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|35|
& \textrm{Evaluate \lstinline[language=scala]|15 + 20|}
\end{array}
\]

\paragraph{Nested Functions}
Scope can appear tricker when working with higher-order functions. But, we can
use the same substitution principle to reason about nested functions.

For example, we wrote the \scalainline{makeAdder} higher-order function before
and used it to create the \scalainline{add10} function:
\begin{scalacode}
def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = {
  def add(y): Int = { x + y }
  add
}

val add10 = makeAdder(10)
\end{scalacode}

The following calculate starts with the definition above (written in a single
line for brevity) and shows that it is equivalent to the more obvious
definition of \scalainline{add10}:
\[
\small
\begin{array}{l|l|l}
 & \textrm{Expression} & \textrm{Reasoning} \\
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{l}
{\lstinline[language=scala]|def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = { def add(y): Int = { x + y }; add }; val add10 = makeAdder(10)|}  \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = { def add(y): Int = { x + 10 }; add }|
& \textrm{Inline \lstinline[language=scala]|makeAdder| and substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|y| with
\lstinline[language=scala]|10|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = { val add = ((y: Int) => { x + 10 }); add }| & \textrm{Rewrite \lstinline[language=scala]|add| using \lstinline[language=scala]|val| notation} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = ((y: Int) => { x + 10 })|
& \textrm{Substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|add| with its definition} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|def add10(y: Int) = x + 10|
& \textrm{Rewrite \lstinline[language=scala]|add| using \lstinline[language=scala]|def| notation}
\end{array}
\]

In fact, every line in this calculation is a valid Scala program (which you
should check!) and all the lines are truly equivalent to each other.

It is always possible to perform these kinds of calculations to simplify
expressions with higher-order functions. For large programs, a detailed
calculation may be infeasibly wrong. But, if you understand how these
calculuations work in detail on small programs, you'll be able to reason
carefully about larger programs without needing to actually do the calculuates
in detail.

\section{Storing Functions in Data Structures\classtime{25}}

Although we've seen that functions can be stored in data structures,
we haven't seen any good examples that suggest why we may want to do so.
For example, here is yet another type that stores functions in its
fields:
\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(
  getX: () => Double,
  getY: () => Double,
  magnitude: () => Double,
  add: Point => Point)
\end{scalacode}

Above, \scalainline{getX}, \scalainline{getY}, and \scalainline{magnitude}
are fields that store functions that consume zero arguments and produce
\scalainline{Double}s.

Consider the following higher-order function, which consumes two coordinates
and produces a point:
\begin{scalacode}
def makePoint(x: Double, y: Double): Point = {
  def getX(): Double = x
  def getY(): Double = y
  def magnitude(): Double = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
  def add(other: Point): Point = makePoint(x + other.getX(), y + other.getY())
  Point(getX, getY, magnitude, add)
}
\end{scalacode}

We can now construct points using \scalainline{makePoint}
and invoke the functions that it defines. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val pt1 = makePoint(3.0, 4.0)
assert(pt1.magnitude() == 5.0)
val pt2 = pt1.add(makePoint(10.0, 10.0))
assert(pt2.getX() == 13.0)
assert(pt1.getY() == 4.0)
\end{scalacode}

Note that this looks an awful lot like vanilla object-oriented programming.
In fact, you could say that \scalainline{makePoint} is a \emph{constructor}
that produces object that have the \emph{interface} \scalainline{Point}
and that \scalainline{getX}, \scalainline{getY}, etc. are \emph{methods} that the
interface defines.
Furthermore, \scalainline{x} and \scalainline{y} are \emph{private fields},
since they are not in scope outside the \scalainline{makePoint}
function.\footnote{However, \scalainline{x} and \scalainline{y} are in scope
for the methods, since they are local to \scalainline{makePoint}.}

This example shows that you can encode object-oriented programs using
higher-order functions. In fact, this example makes essential use of
scope, functions stored in data structures, functions that return
functions (stored in data structures), and all the other characteristics
of first-class functions. With just a little more effort, other object-oriented
ideas like inheritence can be encoded using higher-order functions too.
Conversely, it turns out that higher-order functions can be encoded using
objects, which we will see later in the course. The point of this exercise
is that functional programming and object-oriented programming are two sides
of the same coin.
