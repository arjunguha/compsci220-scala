\section{Hand In}

From \sbt{}, run the command \texttt{submit}. The command will create
a file called \texttt{submission.tar.gz} in your assignment directory.
Submit this file using Moodle.

For example, if the command runs successfully, you will see output similar
to this:
%
\begin{console}
Created submission.tar.gz. Upload this file to Moodle.
[success] Total time: 0 s, completed Jan 17, 2016 12:55:55 PM
\end{console}

\textbf{Note:}  The command will not allow you to submit code that does not
compile. If your code doesn't compile, you will receive no credit for the
assignment.
