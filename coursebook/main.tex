\textbf{Course Description}: Development of individual skills necessary for
designing, implementing, testing and modifying larger programs, including: use
of integrated design environments, design strategies and patterns, testing,
working with large code bases and libraries, code refactoring, and use of
debuggers and tools for version control.

\section{Introduction\classtime{15}}

\emph{CMPSCI220 Programming Methodology} introduces you to all the concepts
above in the context of a modern programming language,
\href{http://www.scala-lang.org/what-is-scala.html}{Scala}.
Scala lets you write exactly the same kind
of object-oriented code that you've seen in Java. In fact, Scala code and Java
code can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate in the same program; we'll
leverage this feature later in the course. So, design strategies and patterns
that you will learn in this course will be applicable to Java and Scala.
However, you will find that programs in Scala are typically much shorter than
their Java counterparts. With a little experience, we think you'll find Scala
enjoyable to read and write. In addition, by learning a new programming language
you will increase your understanding of Java and programming languages in
general.

An important reason we're using Scala is to expose you to programming techniques
and language features that are beyond the scope of Java. The truth is that
modern software systems are written in a plethora of languages. Moreover, large
systems tend to use several programming languages. Therefore, to succeed in your
computing career, you have to be familiar with several languages and be able to
learn new languages on your own. Programming
languages and constantly invented and abandoned\footnote{\href{http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/news/languageposter_0504.html}{This poster} is a very incomplete history of the birth and death of programming languages.}
 and it is impossible to predict the next big language that everyone
will use or the language you'll need to learn for your next job.

Scala is a big language with many unique features and we are not going to learn
to use them all. Instead, we are going to focus on ideas that Scala shares with
other modern programming languages. Here are some of the key ideas that we will
cover in this course that go beyond Java:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{First-class functions} are a feature of almost every modern language
  and the cornerstone of \emph{functional programming}. They are pervasive in
  JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Swift, and almost all modern languages.

  In fact, \href{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html}}{Java 8} and
  \href{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293608.aspx}{C++11}
  have limited support for first-class functions.

\item \emph{Algebraic data types} are available in Apple Swift, Mozilla Rust,
  Microsoft F\#, and several other programming languages. Programming with
  algebraic data types is very different from programming in an object-oriented
  style. We'll cover both styles of programming in this course and develop
  a deep understanding of the tradeoffs.

\item \emph{Type inference} is available in modern typed programming languages,
  such as C\# and Swift, and even in a limited form in
  \href{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html}{Java 7}.
  As the name suggests, in a language with type inference, the compiler can
  often ``infer'' or fill-in types that you omit. So, your programs become shorter, but
  retain all the advantages of type checking.

\end{itemize}

The main themes of the course are not language-specific. We will emphasize
the following broad ideas that are applicable to all software development:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Testing} is critical for building reliable software. You will learn how
  to think like a tester and make effective use of testing tools and frameworks.
  Every programming problem you solve in this course will have to be tested. We
  expect you to write good tests yourself. The quality of your tests will be a
  significant portion of your grade on every assignment.

\item \emph{Design patterns} are recipes for solving typical programming
  problems. You'll learn object-oriented design patterns applicable to Java and
  functional design patterns that are applicable to a variety of modern
  languages.

\item \emph{Refactoring} is a key concept that we emphasize throughout the
  course. As we introduce new ideas, we will systematically refactor our old
  code to exploit them.

\item \emph{Debugging} is a necessary skill because even small programs often
  have bugs.

\item \emph{Command-line tools} such as compilers and build tools lie under the
  hood of sophisticated IDEs such as Eclipse. Learning to use the command-line
  will make you a better IDE user. Moreover, since many new languages lack good
  IDEs, we will emphasize the use of command-line tools in this course.

\item \emph{Version control} software is critical for collaborative software
  development and used by all professional programmers. Although you will be
  programming alone in the course, version control will still help you organize
  your programming and save you a lot of time if you accidentally delete or
  break your code.

\item \emph{Using libraries} is critical for writing software that gets real
  work done. Initially, you'll use libraries that were developed specifically
  for this course, but you will eventually learn to discover and use software
  libraries on the Web.

\end{itemize}

The overarching goal of this course is to make you a better programmer,
and an important part of that is to get familiar with programming terminology
and culture. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation on the Web
about programming, but we will try to point you to sources that are reliable.
Here are two good places to start:
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item \href{http://paulgraham.com/articles.html}{Paul Graham's Essays}.
  The earlier essays are particularly pertinent, E.g.,
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/avg.html}{Beating the Averages} and
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/popular.html}{Being Popular}.

  \item \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com}{Joel Spolsky's blog}. E.g.,
  \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html}
  {Advice for Computer Science College Students}
  and \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html}
  {Getting Your Resume Read}.

\end{itemize}

Finally, \href{http://xkcd.com}{XKCD} comics often make obscure programming
references and this course will help you decipher some of them.

\section{The Command-Line\classtime{5}}

The \emph{Linux command-line}\footnote{The command-line is also known as a
\emph{terminal} or \emph{shell}.} is  a critical part of this course. If you're
using the course virtual-machine, you should the program \textbf{LXTerminal}
to start the command-line.


Unless you're already familiar with the Linux command-line, you must read
\href{http://learncodethehardway.org/cli/book/cli-crash-course.html}{Zed Shaw's Command Line Crash Course},
up to and including the chapter ``Removing a File (rm)''. Zed likes to swear at
his own readers, so we'd like to apologize in advance on his behalf. The rest
of these lecture notes assume that you are familiar with the command-line.

\begin{instructor}
\begin{itemize}

\item Introduce the course VM.

\item  Introduce the command line (\verb|mkdir|, \verb|cd|, and, \verb|ls|).
\end{itemize}

\end{instructor}

\section{\sbt{} and the Scala REPL\classtime{5}}

\sbt{} is the Swiss Army Knife of Scala programming. It is a command-line tool
that can be use to run Scala programs, compile them, test them, package them
deployment, publish them to the Web, and more. Like many modern programming
languages, \sbt{} has a \emph{REPL} (read-eval-print loop), which you can use to
type in and run one-line programs immediately, without the bother of creating
files, etc.

To start the Scala REPL, open a terminal (LXTerminal on the course VM),
type in \verb|sbt console| and press enter. Your screen will look like this:
%
\begin{verbatim}
student@vm:~$ sbt console
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/arjun/.sbt/0.13/plugins
[info] Set current project to del (in build file:/Users/arjun/scratch/del/)

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala>
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|scala>| prompt indicates that you can type in Scala expressions to evaluate.

\section{Scala Basics\classtime{15}}

\subsection{Simple Expressions and Names}

Arithmetic in Scala is very similar to arithmetic in Java:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> 19 * 17
res0: Int = 323
\end{verbatim}

Strings in Scala will also look familiar:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> "Hello, " + "world"
res1: String = Hello, world
\end{verbatim}

Boolean expressions will be familiar too:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> true && false
res2: Boolean = false
\end{verbatim}

Let's examine the last interaction more closely. When you type \verb|true && false|,
Scala prints three things:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item An automatically-generated \emph{name} (\verb|res2|),
\item The \emph{type} of the expression (\verb|Boolean|), and
\item The \emph{value} of the expression (\verb|false|).
\end{itemize}

On the Scala REPL, you can use the generated name as a variable. But, you're
better off picking meaningful names yourself using \verb|val|:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> val mersenne = 524287
mersenne : Int = 524287
scala> val courseName = "Programming Methodology"
courseName : String = Programming Methodology
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Type Inference}

You'll find that Scala programs are significantly shorter than their Java
counterparts. A key feature of Scala that lets you write less code is \emph{type
inference}. Notice in the variable definitions above, you did not have to write
any types. Instead, Scala \emph{inferred} them for you. This feature is very helpful
in larger programs, where types can become complex.

Type inference is not magic; later in the course, you'll learn more about how it
works and when it doesn't. For now, here's a rule of thumb: Scala can infer the
type of variable named with \verb|val|. But, Scala \emph{cannot} infer the type of
function parameters.

\subsection{Functions}

Here is a very simple Scala function:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> def double(n: Int): Int = n + n
double: (n: Int)Int
\end{verbatim}

This code defines a function called \verb|double|, which takes an argument called
\verb|n| of type \verb|Int| and returns a value of type \verb|Int|. We can apply the
function as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> double(10)
res3: Int = 20
\end{verbatim}

The following function takes two arguments, \verb|x| and \verb|y|, and calculates the
distance from the point \verb|(x,y)| to the origin:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> def dist(x: Double, y: Double): Double = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
dist: (x: Double, y: Double)Double

scala> dist(3.0, 4.0)
res4: Double = 5.0
\end{verbatim}

Notice that unlike variable definitions, we need \emph{type annotations}
on function parameters and result types.

If your function actually fits on a line (without scrolling off your window),
you can define them very tersely as shown above. But, many interesting
functions span several lines and need local variables.

\subsection{Blocks and Local Variables}

You can define local variables within a \emph{block}. A block is code delimited by
curly-braces. For example:

\begin{scalacode}
def dist2(x: Double, y: Double): Double = {
  val xSq = x * x
  val ySq = y * y
  math.sqrt(xSq + ySq)
}

dist2(3.0, 4.0)
\end{scalacode}

\section{Scala Source Files\classtime{5}}


\begin{itemize}


\item Copy the functions defined in the REPL into a \verb|.scala| file and
 recompile.

\begin{verbatim}
// Scala wart: Do *not* "extend App" because it can't be evaluated in console.
object Lecture1 {

  def fac(n: Int) = if (n == 0) 1 else (n * fac(n - 1))

}
\end{verbatim}

\item Re-enter the console and show students how to run the functions saved
to the file.

\begin{verbatim}
import Lecture1._
fac(10)
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\section{Testing\classtime{5}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Introduce the idea of test-cases (students know JUnit). Use the console
to create \verb|test/main/scala| and create a test file:

\begin{verbatim}
class Lecture1Tests extends org.scalatest.FunSuite {

  test("fac -- base case") {
    assert(fac(0) == 1)
  }

  test("fac -- inductive case") {
    assert(fac(5) == 120)
  }

}
\end{verbatim}

\item Show \verb|sbt test|.

\item Propose a new function to write. Write the test-cases first, then
the implementation and re-run \verb|sbt test|.

\item Recap the development methodology: first write tests cases, then
write the implementation, and re-test continuously. Show continuous
testing with \verb|~test|.

\end{itemize}

\section{Building and Pattern-Matching on Lists\classtime{25}}

\begin{itemize}

\item Using the console, introduce lists.
First show \verb|Nil|, then \verb|::|. Discuss the type of \emph{non-empty lists}
that is printed on the console and allude to type inference.

\item Write the \verb|sum| function:

\begin{verbatim}
def sum(lst: List[Int]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 0
  case n :: rest => n + sum(rest)
}
\end{verbatim}

This is the first example of pattern matching and the first written occurence of
the list type.

\item Some more functions that don't involve generics:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def product(lst: List[Int]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 1
  case n :: rest => n * product(rest)
}

def double(lst: List[Int]): List[Int] = lst match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case n :: rest => (2 * n) :: double(rest)
}

def repeatTwice(lst: List[Int]): List[Int] = lst match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case n :: rest => n :: n :: repeatTwice(rest)
}
\end{verbatim}

\item Pattern matching is quite powerful, you can express complex conditionals
by just writing a pattern. For example, this function counts the number of
$1$s in a list:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def countOnes(lst: List[Int]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 0
  case n :: rest => if (n == 1) 1 + countOnes(rest) else countOnes(rest)
}
\end{verbatim}

\item But, we can write it more compactly using patterns:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def countOnes(lst: List[Int]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 0
  case 1 :: rest => 1 + countOnes(rest)
}
\end{verbatim}

\item If we try to compile this, we get an \emph{exhuastivity error}. Here
is the fix:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def countOnes(lst: List[Int]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 0
  case 1 :: rest => 1 + countOnes(rest)
  case _ :: rest => countOnes(rest)

}
\end{verbatim}

\item Introduce \verb|List(x, y, z)| as shorthand for \verb|x :: y :: z :: Nil|.

\item \verb|List| can be used in patterns too:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def isSingleton(lst: List[Int]): Boolean = lst match {
  case List(_) => true
  case _ => false
}
\end{verbatim}

\item Emphasize that pattern matching can be used on arbitrary data structures,
including data structures that you define, which we will see later.

\item Show that \verb|if| is a form of pattern matching.

\end{itemize}

  \item Slowly talk through the command-line commands involved in creating,
  changing to it, and starting \sbt{}.

  \item Create a file with a simple list-processing function. (Pick something

\begin{subfigure}[b]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{javacode}

  double x;

  public Point(double x, double y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

}

Point pt = new Point(1, 2)
\end{javacode}
\caption{A Java class that represents a point.}\label{javapoint}
\end{subfigure}
\vrule
%
\begin{subfigure}[b]{.45\textwidth}

class Point(x : Double, y : Double)
val pt = new Point(1, 2)
\end{scalacode}
\caption{A Scala class that represents a point.}\label{scalapoint}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Scala code is usually much shorter and simpler than Java code.}
\end{figure}

\section{Case Classes\classtime{10}}

Just like Java, Scala has classes and even supports advanced features that are
beyond the scope of classes in Java. Scala classes tend to be shorter than their
Java counterparts. For example, \cref{javapoint} shows a \verb|Point| class
in Java and \cref{scalapoint} shows the equivalent class in Scala, which
is much shorter!

Naturally, if want to add methods or other constructors, you'll have to write
more code in Scala too. But, simple classes tend to be very short.
But, we are not going to use classes yet. Instead, we are going to use
\emph{case classes}, which are unique to Scala.

If you write \verb|case class| instead of just \verb|class|, you get several
conveniences:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(x: Double, y: Double)
\end{scalacode}

First, you can create values without writing \verb|new|:

\begin{scalacode}
val pt = Point(1, 2)
\end{scalacode}

Second, case classes have an automatically generated \verb|toString| method that
prints the fields:

\begin{verbatim}
scala> pt
pt: Point = Point(1.0,2.0)
\end{verbatim}

Third, all fields are public by default, so you can easily write simple
functions, such as the this one, without writing getters:

\begin{scalacode}
def magnitude(pt: Point) : Double = {
  math.sqrt(pt.x * pt.x + pt.y * pt.y)
}

test("3-4-5 triangles") {
  assert(magnitude(Point(3, 4)) == 5)
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Sealed Case Classes\classtime{20}}

Imagine you're a new age librarian, tasked with cataloging information on the
Internet. There are many types of information. Here are some significant ones:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Tweet(user: String, number: Long)
case class Xkcd(number: Int)
case class HackerNews(item: Int, points: Int)
\end{scalacode}

Here are some examples:

\begin{scalacode}
// https://twitter.com/PLT_Borat/status/248038616654299136
val tweet = Tweet("PLT_Borat", 248038616654299136L)
// http://xkcd.com/1316/
val comic = Xkcd(1316)
// https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8169367
val news = HackerNews(8169367, 305)
\end{scalacode}

Let's write a function called \verb|getURL| that maps these items to their URLs,
which is easy to do with pattern matching.

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Any): String = item match {
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
  case _ => sys.error("not a library item")
}
\end{scalacode}

This definition is unsatisfactory. \verb|getURL| takes values of \verb|Any|
type. So, it is really easy to get a runtime error:

\begin{console}
scala> getURL("hello")
java.lang.RuntimeException: not a library item
 at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:27)
  at cmpsci220.package$$anonfun$1.apply(package.scala:13)
  at cmpsci220.package$$anonfun$1.apply(package.scala:13)
  at .getURL(<console>:38)
  ... 33 elided
\end{console}

To eliminate this kind of error, we need an \verb|Item| type:

\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait Item
case class Tweet(user: String, number: Long) extends Item
case class Xkcd(number: Int) extends Item
case class HackerNews(item: Int, points: Int) extends Item
\end{scalacode}

A \emph{trait} in Scala is like an \emph{interface}. They're also much more
versatile than interfaces, but we'll get into that later.

Now, we can rewrite \verb|getURL|, restricting argument type:

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
}
\end{scalacode}

This time, applying \verb|getURL| to a non-item produces a type error as expected:

\begin{console}
scala> item("hello")
<console>:43: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("hello")
 required: Item
              getURL("hello")
\end{console}

A really nice feature of `match` is that it checks to ensure you've handled all
cases. For example, suppose we forgot to write the HackerNews case. Scala
prints the following error:

\begin{console}
<console>:18: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: HackerNews(_, _)
       def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
                                        ^
error: No warnings can be incurred under -Xfatal-warnings.
\end{console}

\section{Sealed Classes\classtime{15}}

You can use `match` to also match concrete values. For example, here is
variant of getURL that censors a particular tweet from PLT Borat:

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
  case Tweet("PLT_Borat", 301113983723794432L) => "http://disney.com"
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
}
\end{scalacode}

Imagine you'd added the censoring line, but accidentally removed the line
that handles all other Tweets. Again, Scala will catch the error:

\begin{console}
<console>:62: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs:
  Tweet("PLT_Borat", (x: Long forSome x not in 301113983723794432L)),
  Tweet((x: String forSome x not in "PLT_Borat"), 301113983723794432L),
  Tweet((x: String forSome x not in "PLT_Borat"), _),
  Tweet(_, (x: Long forSome x not in 301113983723794432L))
       def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
                                        ^
error: No warnings can be incurred under -Xfatal-warnings.
\end{console}

It is a long error message. But, if you read it carefully, you'll see that it is
very precisely describing exactly the cases that are missing.

\section{Addition Examples\classtime{35}}

\chapter{Lecture 3}


\section{Generics and Type Inference}

\begin{itemize}

\item Students should know generics, so just show the notation for defining
functions:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def length[A](lst: List[A]): Int = lst match {
  case Nil => 0
  case _ :: rest => 1 + length(rest)
}

def reverseHelper[A](lst: List[A], reversed: List[A]): List[A] = lst match {
  case Nil => reversed
  case head :: tail => reverse(tail, head :: reversed)
}
def reverse[A](lst: List[A]): List[A] = reverseHelper(lst, Nil)
\end{verbatim}


\item Discuss type inference: \verb|List[Int](1,2,3)| is the same as
\verb|List(1, 2, 3)|. Scala figures out the type.

\item Show an example of a nested list and discuss type inference.

\item \emph{Scala Pitfall:} \verb|List(1, "2", 3)| has type \verb|List[Any]|,
but it's almost certainly not what you had in mind!
\verb|List[Int](1, "2", 3)| does not type-check.

\item \emph{Preach:} Type inference is not magic. It saves you typing, but
don't expect it to figure out exactly what you mean. It can make mistakes.
Ensure you know what type expressions have. You'll learn how to do this
with practice.

\end{itemize}
