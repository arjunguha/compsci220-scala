This course could not have come together without materials and inspiration from
several sources.

Many lectures and reading materials are based on these texts:

How to Design Programs by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi

Pure Functional Data Structures by Okasaki

Programming in Scala by Oderksy, Spoon, and Venners

You should read these, even if you’ve taken this course.

For several assignments, we use a graphics library based on the one documented in this article: A Functional I/O System by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi.

Some of our assignments are adapted from other sources:

The Join Lists assignment from CS19 at Brown University by Krishnamurthi, et al

The Tic Tac Toe assignment is adapted from CMPSCI383 by Liberatore

The Sudoku assignment is adapted from Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle by Norvig

\section{Introduction\classtime{15}}

\emph{COMPSCI220 Programming Methodology} introduces advanced programming
techniques in the context of a modern programming language:
\href{http://www.scala-lang.org/}{Scala}.
You could use Scala to write exactly the same kind
of object-oriented code that you've seen in Java. In fact, Scala code and Java
code can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate in the same program; we'll
leverage this feature later in the course. In fact, many of the design patterns
that you will learn in this course will be applicable to Java and Scala.

However, a key reason we're using Scala is to expose you to programming techniques
and language features that are beyond the scope of Java. Most
modern software systems are written in a plethora of languages. In fact, large
systems tend to use several programming languages. Therefore, to succeed in your
computing career, you have to be familiar with several languages and be able to
learn new languages on your own. Programming
languages are constantly invented and abandoned\footnote{\href{http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/news/languageposter_0504.html}{This poster} is a very incomplete history of the birth and death of programming languages.}
 and it is impossible to predict the next language that everyone
will use or the language you'll need to learn for your first job.

Scala is a big language with many unique features and we are not going to learn
to use them all. Instead, we are going to focus on ideas that Scala shares with
other modern programming languages. Here are some of the key ideas that we will
cover in this course that go beyond Java:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{First-class functions} are the cornerstone of \emph{functional programming}.
  They are pervasive in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Swift, and almost all modern
  languages.
  In fact, even \href{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html}}{Java} and
  \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp}{C++} recently
  added support for first-class functions.

\item \emph{Algebraic data types} are available in Apple Swift, Mozilla Rust,
  Microsoft F\#, and several other programming languages. Programming with
  algebraic data types is very different from programming in an object-oriented
  style. We'll cover both styles of programming in this course and develop
  a deep understanding of the tradeoffs.

\item \emph{Type inference} is available in modern typed programming languages,
  such as C\# and Swift, and even in a limited form in
  \href{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html}{Java}.
  As the name suggests, in a language with type inference, the compiler can
  often ``infer'' or fill-in types that you omit. So, your programs become shorter, but
  retain all the advantages of type checking.

\end{itemize}

The main themes of the course are not language-specific. We will emphasize
the following broad ideas that are applicable to all software development:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Testing} is critical for building reliable software. You will learn how
  to test complex functions and make effective use of testing tools and frameworks.
  Every programming problem you solve in this course will have to be tested. We
  expect you to write good tests yourself. The quality of your tests will be a
  significant portion of your grade on every assignment.

\item \emph{Design patterns} are recipes for solving typical programming
  problems. This course will emphasize object-oriented and functional
  design patterns. We will focus on design patterns that are applicable to
  a variety of programming languages, and not Scala-specific design patterns.

\item \emph{Refactoring} is a key concept that we emphasize throughout the
  course. As we introduce new ideas, we will systematically refactor our old
  code to exploit them.

\item \emph{Debugging} is a necessary skill because even small programs often
  have bugs.

\item \emph{Command-line tools} such as compilers and build tools lie under the
  hood of sophisticated IDEs such as Eclipse. Learning to use the command-line
  will make you a better IDE user. Moreover, many newer languages lack good
  IDEs. Therefore, if you want to master the latest technologies, you will
  need to master the command-line.

% Seriously, we do not teach this.

% \item \emph{Version control} software is critical for collaborative software
%   development and used by all professional programmers. Although you will be
%   programming alone in the course, version control will still help you organize
%   your programming and save you a lot of time if you accidentally delete or
%   break your code.

\item \emph{Using libraries} is critical for writing software that gets real
  work done. Initially, you'll use libraries that were developed specifically
  for this course, but you will eventually learn to discover and use
  libraries from the Web.

\end{itemize}

The overarching goal of this course is to make you a better programmer,
and an important part of that is to get familiar with programming terminology
and culture. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation on the Web
about programming, but we will try to point you to sources that are reliable.
Here are two good places to start:
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item \href{http://paulgraham.com/articles.html}{Paul Graham's Essays}.
  The earlier essays are particularly pertinent, E.g.,
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/avg.html}{Beating the Averages} and
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/popular.html}{Being Popular}.

  \item \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com}{Joel Spolsky's blog}. E.g.,
  \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html}
  {Advice for Computer Science College Students}
  and \href{http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html}
  {Getting Your Resume Read}.

\end{itemize}

Finally, \href{http://xkcd.com}{XKCD} comics often make obscure programming
references and this course will help you decipher some of them.

\section{The Command-Line\classtime{5}}

The \emph{\textsc{Unix} command-line}\footnote{The command-line is also known as a
\emph{terminal} or \emph{shell}.} is  a critical part of this course:

\begin{itemize}

\item If you're
using the course virtual-machine, you should use the program \textbf{LXTerminal}
to start the command-line.

\item If you're using macOS, you get to command line by running the
launching the \textbf{Terminal} application, which is in the
\textbf{Applications} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Utilities} folder.

% \item If you're using Windows 10, you can use \textbf{Bash for Windows}.

% \item If you're using an earlier version of Windows, you can install and
% run \textbf{Cygwin}.

\end{itemize}

Unless you're already familiar with the command-line, you must read
\href{https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html}{Zed Shaw's Command Line Crash Course},
up to and including the chapter ``Removing a File (rm)''. Zed likes to swear at
his own readers, so we'd like to apologize in advance on his behalf. The rest
of these lecture notes assume that you are familiar with the command-line.

\section{\sbt{} and the Scala REPL\classtime{5}}

\sbt{} is the Swiss Army Knife of Scala programming. It is a command-line tool
that can be use to run Scala programs, compile them, test them, package them for
deployment, publish them to the Web, and more. Like many modern programming
languages, \sbt{} has a \emph{REPL} (read-eval-print loop), which you can use to
type in and run one-line programs immediately, without the bother of creating
files, etc.

To start the Scala REPL, open a terminal,
type in \verb|sbt console| and press enter. Your screen will look like this:
%
\consolefile{includes/sbtconsole.txt}

The \verb|scala>| prompt indicates that you can type in Scala expressions.

\section{Scala Basics\classtime{15}}

\subsection{Simple Expressions and Names}

Arithmetic in Scala is very similar to arithmetic in Java:

\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> 19 * 17
res0: Int = 323
\end{lstlisting}

Strings in Scala will also look familiar:

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> "Hello, " + "world"
res1: String = Hello, world
\end{lstlisting}

Boolean expressions will be familiar too:

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> true && false
res2: Boolean = false
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=scala}
Let's examine the last interaction more closely. When you type \lstinline|true && false|,
Scala prints three things:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item An automatically-generated \emph{name} (\lstinline|res2|),
\item The \emph{type} of the expression (\lstinline|Boolean|), and
\item The \emph{value} of the expression (\lstinline|false|).
\end{itemize}

On the Scala REPL, you can use the generated name as a variable. But, you're
better off picking meaningful names yourself using \lstinline|val|:
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val mersenne = 524287
mersenne : Int = 524287
scala> val courseName = "Programming Methodology"
courseName : String = Programming Methodology
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Type Inference}

You'll find that Scala programs are significantly shorter than their Java
counterparts. A key feature of Scala that lets you write less code is \emph{type
inference}. Notice in the variable definitions above, you did not have to write
any types. Instead, Scala \emph{inferred} them for you. This feature is very helpful
in large programs, where types can become long and complicated.

Type inference is not magic; later in the course, you'll learn more about how it
works and when it doesn't. For now, here's a rule of thumb: Scala can infer the
type of variable named with \verb|val|. But, Scala \emph{cannot} infer the type of
function parameters.

\subsection{Functions}

Here is a very simple Scala function:

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> def twice(n: Int): Int = n + n
double: (n: Int)Int
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=scala}
This code defines a function called \lstinline|twice|, which takes an argument
\lstinline|Int|. We can apply the function as follows:
called \lstinline|n| of type \lstinline|Int| and returns a value of type
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> twice(10)
res3: Int = 20
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=scala}
The following function takes two arguments, \lstinline|x| and \lstinline|y| and calculates the
distance from the point \lstinline|(x,y)| to the origin:
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> def dist(x: Double, y: Double): Double = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
dist: (x: Double, y: Double)Double

scala> dist(3.0, 4.0)
res4: Double = 5.0
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that unlike variable definitions, we need \emph{type annotations}
on function parameters and result types.

If your function actually fits on a line (without scrolling off your window),
you can define them very tersely as shown above. But, many interesting
functions span several lines and need local variables.

\subsection{Blocks and Local Variables}

You can define local variables within a \emph{block}. A block is code delimited by
curly-braces. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> def dist2(x: Double, y: Double): Double = {
  val xSq = x * x
  val ySq = y * y
  math.sqrt(xSq + ySq)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\scalafile{code/Lecture1fac.scala}
\caption{A Scala module}
\label{lecture1code}
\end{figure}

\section{\sbt{} Project Structure\classtime{5}}
\lstset{language=console}
In principle, you can write a full-fledged program line-by-line in the Scala
console. But, it makes a lot more sense to save large programs to files
for a particular \emph{project}. To do so, we will being by creating a new directory
for your project. Every time you create a new Scala program (e.g., for a homework
assignment) you should create a new project.

First, exit the Scala console by typing \verb|:quit| and then exit \sbt{}
by typing \verb|exit|. You should return to the command-line:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> :quit

[success] Total time: 3 s, completed Jan 13, 2016 8:47:38 PM

sbt> exit
student@vm:~$
\end{lstlisting}

At the terminal, let's create a directory for the project:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
student@vm:~$ mkdir lecture1
\end{lstlisting}
%
Then, let's enter the directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
student@vm:~$ cd lecture1
student@vm:~/lecture1$
\end{lstlisting}
Notice that the name of the directory is displayed on the command-line.

Your Scala projects will have two kinds of files: test cases and your implementation.
\sbt{} requires you to organize your files into the following directory
structure:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\dirtree{%
.1 ~/lecture1.
.2 src.
.3 main.
.4 scala\DTcomment{Implementation goes here}.
.3 test.
.4 scala\DTcomment{Tests go here}.
}
\end{minipage}

You can create these directories by running the following commands:
\consolefile{includes/mkdirs.txt}

We will now see how to save Scala code to files. Using a text editor,
create a file called \verb|Lecture1.scala| in the
\verb|src/main/scala| directory, with the contents shown in \cref{lecture1code}.
The code creates an object with a single function to calculate factorials.

When you write functions in a Scala file, you \emph{have} to place it in
an object. You cannot just write \lstinline|def fac ...| without an enclosing
object. This is a peculiarity of Scala that we will explain later in the course.
In this example, the name of the object is ``Lecture1'', but it can be anything
you like.

\lstset{language=console}
Now that we've saved this function to a file, we can use it from the console:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
sbt> console
scala> import Lecture1._
scala> fac(10)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\lstset{language=scala}
\begin{lstlisting}
// src/main/scala/Lecture1Tests.scala
import Lecture1._

class Lecture1Tests extends org.scalatest.FunSuite {

  test("fac -- base case") {
    assert(fac(0) == 1)
  }

  test("fac -- inductive case") {
    assert(fac(5) == 120)
  }

}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Unit tests for the code in \cref{lecture1code}}
\label{lecture1tests}
\end{figure}

\section{Testing\classtime{5}}

The \sbt{} console is a convenient way to experiment with new code or write
a ``one off'' functionn. However, you must write \emph{unit tests} to test
any actual code you write. \Cref{lecture1tests} shows an example of
unit tests that use the \emph{ScalaTest} library. The code is quite self-explanatory:
each test suite is a class that extends \lstinline|org.scalatest.FunSuite|.
The body of the class has several test blocks, as shown in the figure.

\section{Building and Pattern-Matching on Lists\classtime{25}}
\lstset{language=scala}

In this section, we will show you how to write simple list-processing functions.
We will cover basic \emph{functional programming} and introduce \emph{pattern
matching}. You should try out all the code yourself using the \sbt{} console.

\subsection{Constructing Lists}

The simplest list is the empty list, which is written in Scala as
%
\begin{lstlisting}
Nil
\end{lstlisting}
%
Given the empty list, we can construct larger lists using the \lstinline|::|
operator (which is pronounced \emph{cons}). Here is a simple example that
constructs a one-element list:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
50 :: Nil
\end{lstlisting}
Given a one-element list, we can build a two-element list by using the
\lstinline|::| operator again:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
100 :: (50 :: Nil)
\end{lstlisting}
%
We can use \lstinline|::| again to build a three-element list:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
200 :: (100 :: (50 :: Nil))
\end{lstlisting}
%
In an expression \lstinline|x :: y|,
\lstinline|x| is known as the \emph{head} of the list and \lstinline|y| is
known as the \emph{tail}. Note that the tail of a list is always a list itself,
(though it may be the empty list \lstinline|Nil|).

For example, consider the list below:
\begin{lstlisting}
val letters = "a" :: ("b" :: Nil)
\end{lstlisting}
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item The head of \lstinline|letters| is \lstinline|"a"|.

  \item The tail of \lstinline|letters| is \lstinline|"b" :: Nil|.

  \item The head of the tail of \lstinline|letters| is \lstinline|"b"|.

  \item The tail of the tail of \lstinline|letters| is \lstinline|Nil|.

  \item \lstinline|Nil| does not have a head or a tail.

\end{itemize}

In our examples so far, we've used parenthesis to make the head and tail clear.
However, you can simply write \lstinline|"a" :: "b" :: "c" :: Nil|. Intuitively,
everything to the right of a \lstinline|::| is the tail. If you get confused, write the parenthesis explicitly.

It is usually easier to write lists in the following way:
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item \lstinline|List("a", "b", "c")| is equivalent to
  \lstinline|"a" :: ("b" :: ("c" :: Nil))|.

  \item \lstinline|List()| is equivalent to \lstinline|Nil|.

\end{itemize}
%
However, it is important to understand that this is just a convenient notation.
Under the hood, Scala transforms these expressions to use \lstinline|::|
and \lstinline|Nil|, as we described above.

\paragraph{Lists and Type Inference}
\lstset{language=console}
Consider the following interaction, which you should try yourself:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val lst = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil
lst: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
\end{lstlisting}
%
\lstset{language=scala}

As you can see, Scala prints lists using the shorthand notation,
even if you explicitly use \lstinline|::| and \lstinline|Nil|.
More significantly, Scala has inferred that the type of the list
is \lstinline|List[Int]|. There was no need to explicitly state that
is is the case.

Here is another example, where Scala infers that the type of a list is
\lstinline|List[String]|:
%
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val lst = List("a", "b", "c")
lst: List[String] = List("a", "b", "c")
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=scala}
Type inference is very convenient and spares you from having to explicitly
specify the type of the element. However, type inference is not magic
and can behave in unexpected ways. For example, in the interaction
below, Scala infers that the type of the list is \lstinline|List[Any]|:
%
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val lst = List("a", 10, "c")
lst: List[Any] = List("a", 10, "c")
\end{lstlisting}
Although this is technically true, if you write this code, it is more
likely that you made a mistake and intended to actually create a list of
strings. If you're ever unsure, you can write the type explicitly, which
would signal a type error in this case:
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val lst = List[String]("a", 10, "c")
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(10)
 required: String
       val lst = List[String]("a", 10, "c")
                                   ^
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\lstset{language=scala}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
def countDown(n: Int): List[Int] = {
  if (n == 0) {
    Nil
  }
  else {
    n :: countDown(n - 1)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

    lo :: fromTo(lo + 1, hi)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{}
\label{fromTo}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Functions that produce lists.}
\label{listcons}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Functions that produce lists}

Now that we've seen how to construct lists explicitly, it is straightforward
to write functions that produce lists. \Cref{listcons} shows some simple
recursive functions that construct new lists.

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
def product(alist: List[Int]): Int = {
  alist match {
    case Nil => 1
    case n :: tail => n * product(tail)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Calculate the product of a list of numbers.}
\end{subfigure}
\hskip 2em
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
def repeatTwice(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  alist match {
    case Nil => Nil
    case n :: tail => n :: n :: repeatTwice(tail)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Repeats every element of a list twice.}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Two simple functions that consume lists.}
\label{listconsumers}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Pattern Matching}

Now that we've seen how to write functions that produce lists, we'll
learn how to write functions that consume lists as arguments. We'll
start by writing a simple function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
Here are some examples of of \lstinline|sum| being used:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
assert(sum(20 :: 30 :: Nil) == 50)
assert(sum(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil) == 6)
\end{lstlisting}

Intuitively, to calculate \lstinline|sum(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil)|, we can
can recursively calculate the sum of the tail and add that value to the
head:
\begin{lstlisting}
   sum(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil)
== 1 + sum(2 :: 3 :: Nil)
== 1 + (2 + sum(3 :: Nil))
== 1 + (2 + (3 + sum(Nil)))
\end{lstlisting}
%
The last line shows an important special case. Since the empty list
doesn't have a head or a tail, we need to treat it differently. We'll say
that \lstinline|sum(Nil)| is \lstinline|0|.

We can write \lstinline|sum| by using a powerful feature of
Scala called \emph{pattern matching}.
%
\begin{lstlisting}
def sum(lst: List[Int]): Int = alist match {
  case Nil => 0
  case h :: t => h + sum(t)
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
This code makes it clear that the function is inspecting \lstinline|alist|
and considering two \emph{cases}. When \lstinline|alist| is \lstinline|Nil|,
it produces \lstinline|0| and when \lstinline{alist} is constructed with
the \lstinline|::| operator, the function recurs on the tail and ands
that result to the head. In this code,
\lstinline|Nil| and \lstinline|h :: t| are called \emph{patterns}.

\Cref{listconsumers} shows two more list-consuming functions that
use pattern-matching. Notice that in \lstinline|::| cases, these functions
use different variable names for the head and the tail. A pattern can use
any variable to refer to the value of the head or the tail.

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
\lstset{language=scala}\begin{lstlisting}
def countOnes(alist: List[Int]): Int = {
  alist match {
    case Nil => 0
    case n :: tail => {
      if (n == 1) {
        1 + countOnes(tail)
      }
      else {
        countOnes(tail)
      }
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Counting ones using an if-expression.}
\label{countonescomplex}
\end{subfigure}
\hskip 2em
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
\lstset{language=scala}\begin{lstlisting}
def countOnes(alist: List[Int]): Int = alist match {
  case Nil => 0
  case 1 :: tail => 1 + countOnes(tail)
  case n :: tail => countOnes(tail)
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Counting ones using a composite pattern.}
\label{countonessimple}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Pattern matching can make complex conditionals clearer.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Complex Patterns}
%
Pattern-matching is extremely powerful and can be used to express
complex conditionals. For example, \cref{countonescomplex} is a function
that counts the number of \lstinline|1|s that occur in a list: it uses
pattern matching as introduced above and then an if-expression to
check if the head of the list is \lstinline|1|.

\Cref{countonessimple}
is the same function, rewritten to use pattern matching. This version is shorter
and makes it clear that there are three cases. To do so, we exploit the fact
that patterns can match \emph{almost} any value, including numbers,
strings, lists, and user-defined data structures too (which we will see
in a later class).

\paragraph{Exhaustivity and Reachability Checking}
%
Here is another function that uses pattern matching to count the number
of tens in a list:
%
\lstset{language=scala}\begin{lstlisting}
def countTens(alist: List[Int]): Int = alist match {
  case 10 :: tail => 1 + countTens(tail)
  case n :: tail => countTens(tail)
}
\end{lstlisting}

However, this function had a bug. Do you see it? If you type this into
the console, Scala prints the following:
%
\lstset{language=console}\begin{lstlisting}
<console>:10: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: Nil
       def countTens(alist: List[Int]): Int = alist match {
                                            ^
\end{lstlisting}
%
Scala has detected that we forgot to write a case for \lstinline|Nil|.
Scala ensures that your patterns are \emph{exhaustive}. Here is another
buggy version of the function:
%
\lstset{language=scala}\begin{lstlisting}
def countTens(alist: List[Int]): Int = alist match {
  case n :: tail => 1 + countTens(tail)
  case n :: tail => countTens(tail)
  case Nil => 0
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
In this version, we wrote the patterns incorrectly, so the first and second
patterns are identical. Scala reports the following error:
\lstset{language=scala}\begin{lstlisting}
<console>:13: warning: unreachable code
         case n :: rest => countTens(rest)
\end{lstlisting}
%
Scala ensures that all cases are \emph{reachable}.

This automatic exhaustivity and reachability checking makes programs that
use pattern-matching much more robust than programs that use complicated,
nested if-statements. Pattern matching is a very powerful tool that you can
exploit to make your programs more robust. We will emphasize pattern-matching
over conditionals in this course.

\section{Immutability \classtime{10}}

We want to emphasize that all the functions we've written to produce
lists \emph{produce a new list} and leave the original list unchanged.

You can observe this behavior in the Scala console:
%
\lstset{language=console}\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val original = List(10, 20, 30)
original: List[Int] = List(10, 20, 30)

scala> val result = repeatTwice(original)
result: List[Int] = List(10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30)

scala> original
res0: List[Int] = List(10, 20, 30)

scala> result
res1: List[Int] = List(10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30)
\end{lstlisting}

At no point did we change or \emph{mutate} the original list. In fact, lists in
Scala are \emph{immutable} data structures. There is no way to update their
head or tail. Programming with immutable data structures is a key part of
\emph{functional programming}, which we will emphasize in the first half
of this course.

\section{Case Classes\classtime{10}}

Scala classes tend to be shorter than their
Java counterparts. For example, \cref{javapoint} shows a \scalainline{Point} class
in Java and \cref{scalapoint} shows the equivalent class in Scala, which
is much shorter!
If we start adding methods, you'll have to write
more code in Scala too. But, simple classes tend to be very short.
But, we are not going to use classes yet. Instead, we are going to use
\emph{case classes}, which are unique to Scala.

If you write \scalainline{case class}---
%
\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(x: Double, y: Double)
\end{scalacode}
---instead of just \scalainline{class}, you get several conveniences.
First, you can create values without writing \scalainline{new}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val pt = Point(1, 2)
\end{scalacode}
%
Second, case classes have an automatically generated \scalainline{toString}
method that prints the fields:
%
\begin{console}
scala> pt
pt: Point = Point(1.0,2.0)
\end{console}
%
Finally, all fields are public by default, so you can easily write simple
functions, such as this one, without writing getters:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def magnitude(pt: Point) : Double = {
  math.sqrt(pt.x * pt.x + pt.y * pt.y)
}

test("3-4-5 triangles") {
  assert(magnitude(Point(3, 4)) == 5)
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Sealed Case Classes\classtime{20}}

Imagine you're a new age librarian, tasked with cataloging information on the
Internet. There are many types of information. Here are some significant ones:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Tweet(user: String, number: Long)
case class Xkcd(number: Int)
case class HackerNews(item: Int, points: Int)
\end{scalacode}

Here are some examples:

\begin{scalacode}
// https://twitter.com/PLT_Borat/status/248038616654299136
val tweet = Tweet("PLT_Borat", 248038616654299136L)
// http://xkcd.com/1316/
val comic = Xkcd(1316)
// https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8169367
val news = HackerNews(8169367, 305)
\end{scalacode}

Let's write a function called \verb|getURL| that maps these items to their URLs,
which is easy to do with pattern matching.

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Any): String = item match {
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
  case _ => sys.error("not a library item")
}
\end{scalacode}

This definition is unsatisfactory. \verb|getURL| takes values of
\verb|Any|
type. So, it is really easy to get a runtime error:
\consolefile{includes/runtime-match-error.txt}

To eliminate this kind of error, we need an \verb|Item| type:

\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait Item
case class Tweet(user: String, number: Long) extends Item
case class Xkcd(number: Int) extends Item
case class HackerNews(item: Int, points: Int) extends Item
\end{scalacode}

A \emph{trait} in Scala is like an \emph{interface}. They're also much more
versatile than interfaces, but we'll get into that later.

Now, we can rewrite \verb|getURL|, restricting the argument type:

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
}
\end{scalacode}

This time, applying \verb|getURL| to a non-item produces a type error as expected:

\begin{console}
scala> item("hello")
<console>:43: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("hello")
 required: Item
              getURL("hello")
\end{console}

A really nice feature of \scalainline{match} is that it checks to ensure you've handled all
cases. For example, suppose we forgot to write the HackerNews case. Scala
prints the following error:

\begin{console}
<console>:18: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: HackerNews(_, _)
       def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
                                        ^
error: No warnings can be incurred under -Xfatal-warnings.
\end{console}

\paragraph{More Pattern Matching}

You can use \scalainline{match} to also match concrete values. For example, here is
variant of getURL that censors a particular tweet from PLT Borat:

\begin{scalacode}
def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
  case Tweet("PLT_Borat", 301113983723794432L) => "http://disney.com"
  case Tweet(user, number) => "https://twitter.com/" + user + "/status/" + number
  case Xkcd(number) => "http://xkcd.com/" + number
  case HackerNews(item, _) => "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + item
}
\end{scalacode}

Imagine you'd added the censoring line, but accidentally removed the line
that handles all other Tweets. Again, Scala will catch the error:

\begin{console}
<console>:62: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs:
  Tweet("PLT_Borat", (x: Long forSome x not in 301113983723794432L)),
  Tweet((x: String forSome x not in "PLT_Borat"), 301113983723794432L),
  Tweet((x: String forSome x not in "PLT_Borat"), _),
  Tweet(_, (x: Long forSome x not in 301113983723794432L))
       def getURL(item: Item): String = item match {
                                        ^
error: No warnings can be incurred under -Xfatal-warnings.
\end{console}

It is a long error message. But, if you read it carefully, you'll see that it is
very precisely describing exactly the cases that are missing.

\section{Binary Search Trees\classtime{20}}

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait SBinTree
case class SNode(lhs: BinTree, key: Int, value: String, rhs: BinTree) extends SBinTree
case class SLeaf() extends SBinTree

def find(k: Int, t: SBinTree): String = t match {
  case SLeaf() => sys.error("not found")
  case SNode(_, key, value, _) if (k == key) => value
  case SNode(lhs, key, _, _) if (k < key) => find(k, lhs)
  case SNode(_, key, _, rhs) => find(k, rhs)
}

def insert(k: Int, v: String, t: SBinTree): SBinTree = t match {
  case SLeaf() => SNode(SLeaf(), k, v, SLeaf())
  case SNode(lhs, key, _, rhs) if (k == key) => SNode(lhs, key, v, rhs)
  case SNode(lhs, key, value, rhs) if (k <= key) =>  SNode(insert(k, v, lhs), key, value, rhs)
  case SNode(lhs, key, value, rhs) => SNode(lhs, key, value, insert(k, v, rhs))
}

def size(t: BinTree): SBinTree = t match {
  case SLeaf() => 1
  case SNode(lhs, k, v, rhs) => size(lhs) + size(rhs) + 1
}
\end{scalacode}

\caption{Binary search trees.}
\label{bintree}
\end{figure}

\Cref{bintree} shows a type definition for binary search trees, where
keys are integers and values are strings (which is why we call them
\scalainline{SBinTree}s). There are two
kinds of binary trees: (1) empty trees, or \scalainline{SLeaf()}s, and (2)
non-empty trees, or \scalainline{SNode(..)}s, which have a left-subtree,
a numeric key, a string value, and a right-subtree.
Given this definition, we can write canonical functions such
as \scalainline{size}, \scalainline{find}, and \scalainline{insert},
as shown in the same figure.
We emphasize that the \scalainline{insert} function does not modify the
original tree, and instead produces a new binary tree with the element added.


\subsection{Testing}

There is a lot of code in \cref{bintree} that needs to be tested and there
are two categories of tests that we can write. First, we should \emph{test all the
cases} of a function. For example, the \scalainline{insert} function has
four cases and the four tests below are chosen to exercise each case:
\begin{scalacode}
test("insert into empty tree") {
  assert(insert(200, "A", SLeaf()) == SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf()))
}

test("insert into left-subtree") {
  assert(insert(200, "A", SNode(SLeaf(), 500, "B", SLeaf()))
    == SNode(SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf()), 500, "B", SLeaf()))
}

test("insert into right-subtree") {
  assert(insert(700, "A", SNode(SLeaf(), 500, "B", SLeaf()))
    == SNode(Leaf(), 500, "B", SNode(SLeaf(), 700, "A", SLeaf())))
}

test("insert and replace") {
  assert(insert(200, "A", SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "B", SLeaf()))
    == SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf()))
}
\end{scalacode}

A robust test suite should exercise \scalainline{insert} on larger examples, but
it is important to understand exactly what each case is doing, which is what the
descriptive string states.

The second kind if test is to \emph{test properties that relate functions
to each other}. There isn't a neat recipe for these kinds of tests. You have
to think hard about what your code is actually doing. But, here
are some properties for binary trees.

\begin{property}
After we insert a key-value into a tree, we should be able to
find it again.
\end{property}

The following tests check that this property holds on examples
where a key-value is inserted on the left, inserted on the right, or replaces
the root:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val t1 = SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf())

test("find after insert on right") {
  assert(find(500, insert(500, "B", t1)) == "B")
}

test("find after insert on left") {
  assert(find(100, insert(100, "B", t1)) == "B")
}

test("find after insert replaces") {
  assert(find(200, insert(200, "B", t1)) == "B")
}
\end{scalacode}

\begin{property}
Inserting a key-value into a binary tree produces a tree with size one
greater than the original tree.
\end{property}

The following tests check that this property holds for the three
cases of \scalainline{insert}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val t1 = SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf())

test("insert increases size (rhs)")
  assert(size(insert(500, "B", t1) == size(t1) + 1)
}

test("insert increases size (lhs)") {
  assert(size(insert(100, "B", t1) == size(t1) + 1)
}

test("insert increases size (replacement)") {
  assert(size(insert(200, "B", t1) == size(t1) + 1)
}
\end{scalacode}

Unfortunately, the third test case fails because the property is wrong.
When \scalainline{insert} replaces a value in the tree, the size of the tree
does not change. Here is a revised version of this property that accounts
for this corner-case:

\begin{property}
Inserting a key-value into a binary tree either (1) produces a tree with
size one greater than the original tree or (2) the size of the produced
tree is the same and the key was present in the original tree.
\end{property}

We can write a function to test this property for any given $k$, $v$, and $t$
and use it to write our tests compactly:

\begin{scalacode}
def check(k: Int, v: String, t: SBinTree): Boolean = {
  if (size(insert(k, v, t)) == size(t) + 1) {
    true
  }
  else {
    try {
      val r = find(k, t)
      true
    }
    catch {
      case exn:Exception => false
    }
  }
}

val t1 = SNode(SLeaf(), 200, "A", SLeaf())

test("insert increases size (rhs)")
  assert(check(500, "B", t1))
}

test("insert increases size (lhs)") {
  assert(check(100, "B", t1))
}

test("insert increases size (replacement)") {
  assert(check(200, "B", t1))
}
\end{scalacode}

There are other properties that we can test. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
insert(k, v, insert(k, v, t)) == insert(k, v, t)
\end{scalacode}

Moreover, if we write more functions to process binary trees, the number of
interesting properties will keep growing.

\section{Lists\classtime{10}}

Although we've used Scala's builtin lists, we can use case classes to write
very similar types. For example, we can write a type for lists of integers
as follows:
%
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait IList
case class INil() extends IList
case class ICons(head: Int, tail: IList) extends IList
\end{scalacode}

The following function adds $n$ to every number in a list:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def add(n: Int, lst: IList): IList = alist match {
  case INil() => INil()
  case ICons(head, tail) => ICons(head + n, add(n, tail))
}
\end{scalacode}

A test suite should test the two cases in the function. Moreover, we can
also test simple properties of this function alone.

For example, for all \scalainline{m}, \scalainline{n}, and \scalainline{alist}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
add(n, add(m, alist)) == add(m + n, alist)
\end{scalacode}

The following function appends two lists together:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def append(alist1: IList, alist2: IList): IList = alist1 match {
  case INil() => alist2
  case ICons(head, tail) => ICons(head, append(tail, alist2))
}
\end{scalacode}

Again, we should test the two cases of this function. But, there are
several other properties that we can test. For example, if we append
three lists together, the order in which we apply the function
does not matter:
%
\begin{scalacode}
append(alist1, append(alist2, alist3)) == append(append(alist1, alist2), alist3)
\end{scalacode}
i.e., \scalainline{append} is \emph{associative}.

Here is another property of \scalainline{append}:
\begin{scalacode}
append(alist, INil()) == alist
\end{scalacode}
%
Notice that this is \emph{not} a case of \scalainline{append}: the function
pattern-matches on the first argument. This property shows that both cases
of \scalainline{append} behave in a similar way when the second argument is
\scalainline{INil()}.

Finally, we can write properties that relate the \scalainline{add} and
\scalainline{append} functions:
%
\begin{scalacode}
append(add(n, alist1), add(n, alist2)) == add(n, append(alist1, alist2))
\end{scalacode}

\section{Generics and Type Inference\classtime{15}}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{scalacode}
def ilength(alist : List[Int]): Int = {
  alist match {
  case Nil => 0
  case _ :: tail => 1 + ilength(tail)
  }
}
\end{scalacode}
\subcaption{Length of a list of integers.}

\quad\vrule\quad
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{scalacode}
def slength(alist : List[String]): Int = {
  alist match {
    case Nil => 0
    case _ :: tail => 1 + slength(tail)
  }b
}
\end{scalacode}
\subcaption{Length of a list of integers.}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Two very similar length functions.}
\label{monolength}
\end{figure}

\Cref{monolength} shows two functions that calculate (1) the length of a list
of integers and (2) the length of a list of strings. These two functions
are almost identical. The only difference between them in the type of
element in the list. We can abstract away the differences by writing
a \emph{generic} length function:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def length[A](alist: List[A]): Int = alist match {
  case Nil => 0
  case _ :: tail => 1 + length(tail)
}
\end{scalacode}

In the code above, \verb|A| is a \emph{type argument}. It truly is an argument
to the function, just like \verb|alist|. i.e., when \scalainline{length} is
invoked, we need to specify \verb|A|:
%
\begin{scalacode}
length[Int](List(1, 2, 3))
length[String](List("A", "B", "C", "D"))
\end{scalacode}
%
However, \verb|A| holds a type instead of a value.

Scala lets you elide type arguments in most cases. So, we could also write:
%
\begin{scalacode}
length(List(1, 2, 3))
length(List("A", "B", "C", "D"))
\end{scalacode}
%
But, it is important to note that under the hood, Scala figures out that we
meant \scalainline{A} to be \scalainline{Int} on the first line and
\scalainline{String} on the second line and inserts the type arguments for us.
In fact, we relied on this in the definition of \scalainline{length}: Scala
expands the recursive call \scalainline{length(tail)} to
\scalainline{length[A](tail)}. Note that Scala isn't just ``guessing'' the
right type. It uses the type of the value-arguments to infer the missing
type argument.

However, Scala's type inference is not perfect. It saves you typing, but don't
expect it to figure out exactly what you mean. It can make mistakes.
For example, if we write \scalainline{List(1, "2", 3)}, Scala infers
that it has type \scalainline{List[Any]}. But, this is almost certainly
not what we meant! We probably meant to construct a list of integers
or strings. If we instead wrote \scalainline{List[Int](1, "2", 3)}, Scala
would have signalled a type error.

\subsection{Generic Data Structures}

\begin{figure}

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait IBinTree
case class ILeaf() extends IBinTree
case class INode(
  lhs: IBinTree,
  key: Int,
  value: Int,
  rhs: IBinTree)
  extends IBinTree
\end{scalacode}
\caption{Values are integers.}
\end{minipage}
\quad\vrule\quad
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait SBinTree
case class SLeaf() extends IBinTree
case class SNode(
  lhs: SBinTree,
  key: Int,
  value: String,
  rhs: SBinTree)
  extends SBinTree
\end{scalacode}
\caption{Values are strings.}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Two non-generic binary trees.}
\label{monobintrees}
\end{figure}

In the last lecture, we build a data structure that represents binary
search trees with strings for values. We can write a similar data structure
with integer-values, as shown in \cref{monobintrees}. But, this will force
us to redefine the functions we wrote earlier to proceed \scalainline{SBinTree}s.
Instead, we can write a generic type for binary trees where the values have
some unknown type \scalainline{A}:

%
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait BinTree[A]
case class Leaf[A]() extends BinTree[A]
case class Node[A](lhs: BinTree[A], key: Int, value: A, rhs: BinTree[A]) extends BinTree[A]
\end{scalacode}

Here are some examples of binary trees with values of different types:

\begin{itemize}

\item This binary tree has integer values:
\begin{scalacode}
Node(Leaf(), 10, 500, Leaf())
\end{scalacode}

\item This binary tree has string values:
\begin{scalacode}
Node(Leaf(), 10, "five hundred", Leaf())
\end{scalacode}

\item This binary tree has boolean values:
\begin{scalacode}
Node(Leaf(), 10, true, Leaf())
\end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

We can easily update the \scalainline{insert}, \scalainline{find}, and \scalainline{size}
functions from the last lecture to work with generic binary trees.

\end{figure}


\subsection{The Map Function\classtime{15}}

Study the four functions in \cref{map_motivation}. The function \verb|incrs|
adds one to every element in a list of integers, the function \verb|lengths|
calculates the length of every string in a list, the function \verb|doubles|
doubles every number in a list, and the function \verb|negates| negates every
number in a list. Hopefully, you've noticed that these four functions have a lot
of in common. \emph{The only difference between them is the operation that they
perform on the head of the list}.

Here is a variant of \verb|doubles| that makes the operation explicit, by
moving it into a separate function:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def f(n: Int): Int = n * 2

def doubles(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case h :: t => f(h) :: doubles(t)
}
\end{scalacode}

In this version, we're simply applying a function $f$ to $h$, where $f$
is the doubling function.

\begin{think}
Apply the same refactoring to the other
functions. E.g.,  instead of directly writing \scalainline{head.length}, refactor
the function so that this expression is in a helper function.
\end{think}

Once we've re-written the operation as \scalainline{f(h)}, all three
functions look identical: the only difference is that each refers to a
different function.
Instead of writing three functions that are almost identical, we can
write one function that takes $f$ as an argument:

\begin{scalacode}
def map(f: Int => Int, alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case h :: t => f(h) :: map(f, t)
}
\end{scalacode}

With this function, we can make our examples much more succinct:

\begin{scalacode}
def doubles(alist: List[Int]) = {
  def f(n: Int): Int = n * 2
  map(f, alist)
}

def incrs(alist: List[Int]) = {
  def f(n: Int): Int = n + 1
  map(f, alist)
}

def lengths(alist: List[String]) = {
  def f(str: String): Int = str.length
  map(f, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}

Unfortunately, the definition of \scalainline{lengths} above does not
type-check. Scala reports two type errors and they are both very informative:

\begin{console}
<console>:15: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String => Int
 required: Int => Int
         map(f, alist)
             ^
<console>:15: error: type mismatch;
 found   : List[String]
 required: List[Int]
         map(f, alist)
                  ^
\end{console}

The \scalainline{map} function only works of lists of integers. However, if you
look at the definition of \scalainline{map} closely, you'll see that all the
\scalainline{Int}-specific code has been factored out into \scalainline{f}. We
can make the function even more generic by introducing two type-parameters:

\begin{scalacode}
def map[A,B](f: A => B, alist: List[A]): List[B] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case h :: t => f(h) :: map[A, B](f, t)
}
\end{scalacode}

The type-parameter $A$ is the type of the elements in
\emph{alist} and the type-parameter $B$ is the type elements in the produced list.
In the code above, we've make all the type-arguments explicit. But, as we've
discussed before, we can rely on type-inference to fill them in:

\begin{scalacode}
def map[A,B](f: A => B, alist: List[A]): List[B] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case h :: t => f(h) :: map(f, t)
}
\end{scalacode}

\subsection{The Filter Function\classtime{10}}

Another common pattern when programming with lists is to select certain elements
that have some property. For example, here is a function that consumes a list,
and produces a new list that only contains the even numbers:

\begin{scalacode}
def filterEven(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail =>
    (head % 2 == 0) match {
      case true => head :: filterEven(tail)
      case false => filterEven(tail)
    }
}
\end{scalacode}

This is a very common pattern too. For example, we could write a function to
select the odd numbers or the prime numbers. If we had a list of strings, we
could select all the strings with length 5 or all the strings that represent
English-language words. All these functions have the same shape: they test
the value of \scalainline{head} in some way. If the test succeeds, \scalainline{head} is added in
the output list. But, if the test fails, it is excluded.

Following the same strategy we used to derive \scalainline{map}, we first package
the \scalainline{head}-test into a function:

\begin{scalacode}
def f(n: Int): Boolean = head % 2

def filterEven(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail =>
    f(head) match {
      case true => head :: filterEven(tail)
      case false => filterEven(tail)
    }
}
\end{scalacode}

Now that the pattern is clearer, we generalize \scalainline{filterEven} to take \scalainline{f}
as an argument:

\begin{scalacode}
def filter(f: Int => Boolean, alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail =>
    f(head) match {
      case true => head :: filter(f, tail)
      case false => filter(f, tail)
    }
}

def filterEven(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  def f(n: Int): Boolean = head % 2
  filter(f, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}

Finally, just as we did for \scalainline{map}, we can generalize the type of \scalainline{filter}
so that it can be applied to \scalainline{List[A]}:

\begin{scalacode}
def filter[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[A]): List[A] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail =>
    f(head) match {
      case true => head :: filter(f, tail)
      case false => filter(f, tail)
    }
}
\end{scalacode}

\begin{instructor}
Cannot show find because it relies on Option
\end{instructor}

% \subsection{The Find Function\classtime{10}}

% Another common operation on lists is to find an element. For example,
% the following function finds the first even number in a list:

% \begin{scalacode}
% def findEven(alist: List[Int]): Option[Int] = alist match {
%   case Empty() => None()
%   case Cons(head, tail) => (head % 2 == 0) match {
%     case true => Some(head)
%     case false => findEven(tail)
%   }
% }
% \end{scalacode}

% If we change \scalainline{(head % 2 == 0)} to \scalainline{(head % 2 == 1)}, we'll have the
% \scalainline{findOdd} function. Again, instead of defining two slightly different
% functions, we can write the general \scalainline{find} function:

% \begin{scalacode}
% def find[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[A]): Option[A] = alist match {
%   case Empty() => None()
%   case Cons(head, tail) => f(head) match {
%     case true => Some(head)
%     case false => find(f, tail)
%   }
% }
% \end{scalacode}

\subsection{Sorting}

You've written sorting functions that sort lists is ascending or descending
order. But, the following higher-order function can be used to sort any
lists of any type, given an arbitrary ``less than'' operator.

\begin{scalacode}
def insert[A](lessThan: (A, A) => Boolean, x: A, alist: List[A]): List[A] = alist match {
  case Nil => List(x)
  case hd :: tl => {
    if (lessThan(x, hd)) {
      x :: hd :: tl
    }
    else {
      hd :: insert(lessThan, x tl)
    }
  }
}

def sort[A](lessThan: (A, A) => Boolean, alist: List[A]) = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case hd :: tl => insert(lessThan, hd, sort(lessThan, tl))
}

def sortAscending(alist: List[Int]): Int = {
  def f(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean = x < y
  sort(f, alist)
}

def sortDescending(alist: List[Int]): Int = {
  def f(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean = x > y
  sort(f, alist)
}

def sortByLengthAscending(alist: List[String]): Int = {
  def f(x: String, y: String): Boolean = x.length < y.length
  sort(f, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Builtin Methods on Lists\classtime{5}}

All the higher-order list-processing functions that we've defined are already
built-in to Scala as methods on lists.

\begin{itemize}

\item
We can map over a list using the \scalainline{map} method:

\begin{scalacode}
def f(n: Int): Int = n + 1

assert(List(10, 20, 30).map(f) == List(11, 21, 22))
\end{scalacode}

\item We can filter a list using the \scalainline{filter} method:

\begin{scalacode}
def f(n: Int): Boolean = n % 2 == 0

assert(List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map(f) == List(0, 2, 4))
\end{scalacode}

\item We can sort a list using the \scalainline{sortWith} method:

\begin{scalacode}
def f(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean = x > Y

assert(List(3, 7, 9, 11).sortWith(f) == List(11, 9, 7, 3))
\end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

There are several other higher-order functions that you can discover from
the documentation or the Scala console.

\label{folding_prototypes}
\end{figure}

\section{Folding\classtime{20}}
%
The four functions in \cref{folding_prototypes} are examples of
\emph{folding functions}. A folding function ``collapses'' a list into
a single value. A fold is characterized by a binary operation used to
combine values and a base case for the empty list.

\begin{itemize}

\item In \scalainline{sum}, the binary operation is \scalainline{+}
and the base value is \scalainline{0}:
\begin{scalacode}
sum(List(10, 20, 30)) = 10 + (20 + (30 + 0))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{product}, the binary operation is \scalainline{*}
and the base value is \scalainline{1}:
\begin{scalacode}
product(List(2, 3, 4)) = 2 * (3 + (4 * 1))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{concat}, the binary operation is \scalainline{+} (string
concatenation) and the base value is \scalainline{""}:
\begin{scalacode}
concat(List("X", "Y", "Z")) = "X" + ("Y" + ("Z" + ""))
\end{scalacode}

\item In \scalainline{totalLen}, the binary operation is the following
function:
\begin{scalacode}
def binop (hd : String, tailLen : Int) : int = hd.length + tailLen
\end{scalacode}
and the base value is \scalainline{0}:
\begin{scalacode}
totalLen(List("hi", "cs220", "student")) = binop("hi", binop("cs220", binop("student" 0)))
\end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

Now that we've seen the common pattern, it's clear that we abstract
these functions to a higher-order
function that takes three arguments (1) the original list, (2)
a two-argument function instead of a fixed binary operator, and (3) a
value for the base-case, instead of a fixed base-case:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def fold(baseCase: ???, binOp: (???, ???) => ???, alist: List[???]): ??? = alist match {
  case Nil => baseCase
  case head :: tail => binOp(head, fold(baseCase, binOp, tail))
}
\end{scalacode}

We can rewrite the functions in \cref{folding_prototypes} more
succinctly as follows:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def sum(alist : List[Int]) = fold(0, (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y, alist)

def product(alist : List[Int]) = fold(1, (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y, alist)

def concat(alist : List[String]) = fold("", (x: String, y: String) => x + y, alist)

// binOp was defined above
def totalLen(alist : List[Int]) = fold(0, binOp, alist)
\end{scalacode}

Note that in \scalainline{binOp}, the types of the two arguments
are different. The type of the first argument is the same as the
type of the elements in the list. The type of the second argument
is the same as the type of the result of the function. This is because
when \scalainline{binOp} is applied (internally within \scalainline{fold}),
the first argument to  \scalainline{binOp} is an element of the
list, and the second argument is an intermediate result.
Therefore, we can fill in the types in \scalainline{fold} as follows:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def fold[A,B](baseCase: B, binOp: (A, B) => B, alist: List[A]): B = alist match {
  case Nil => baseCase
  case head :: tail => binOp(head, fold(baseCase, binOp, tail))
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Functions are Values\classtime{10}}

\paragraph{Functions can be passed as arguments to functions.}
The last lecture introduced functions can be passed as arguments
to other functions. For example, the function \scalainline{filter(f, alist)}
produces a list of all the items of \scalainline{alist} for which \scalainline{f}
is \scalainline{true}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def filter[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[Int]): List[A] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case Cons(head, tail) =>
    f(head) match {
      case true => head :: filter(f, tail)
      case false => filter(f, tail)
    }
}
\end{scalacode}

This allowed us to write several functions very easily, for example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def isEven(n: Int): Boolean = n % 2 == 0

def onlyEvens(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  filter(isEven, alist)
}

def nonZero(n: Int): Boolean = n != 0

def onlyNonZero(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  filter(nonZero, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}

\paragraph{Functions can be nested within other functions.}

If our goal was to write the list-processing functions, then the
functions \scalainline{isEven} and \scalainline{nonZero}, are
cluttering our code. Another programmer may think that they are signficant,
although they simply exist as trivial helper functions.

Functions can be nested within other functions:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def onlyEvens(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  def isEven(n: Int): Boolean = n % 2 == 0
  filter(isEven, alist)
}

def onlyNonZero(alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
  def nonZero(n: Int): Boolean = n != 0
  filter(nonZero, alist)
}
\end{scalacode}
%
In particular, the names \scalainline{isEven} and \scalainline{nonZero}
are \emph{not defined} outside their respective functions.

\paragraph{Functions can produce functions.}

Functions can also produce other functions. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = {
  def addX(y: Int): Int = x + y
  addX(x)
}

val addThree = makeAdder(3)
test("add3 test") {
  assert(addThree(10) == 13)
}
\end{scalacode}

\paragraph{Functions do not need to be named.}

Unlike other values, functions seem to have the following special property:
every function has a name, but the other kinds of values do not.
For example, we can simply write \scalainline{1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil}
and don't need to give this list a name. So far, all of the functions we've seen
start with \scalainline{def functionName}.

It turns out that this is just a convention. As with other values,
functions don't need names. For example, here is a function that adds two
numbers:

\begin{scalacode}
((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)
\end{scalacode}

This function does not have a name, but it can be applied just like
any other function:

\begin{scalacode}
((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)(10, 20)
\end{scalacode}

The code above is not easy to read. It will be a lot clearer of we give the
function a name. You already know how to name a function using \scalainline{def}. But, all
other values are named using \scalainline{val}. In fact, we can use \scalainline{val} to name functions
too, just like any other type of value:

\begin{scalacode}
val adder = ((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)

adder(10, 20)
\end{scalacode}

You should think of \scalainline{def} as a convenient shorthand for naming functions.
That is, these two definitions are equivalent:

\begin{scalacode}
val adder = ((x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)

def adder(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
\end{scalacode}

In general, it is a good idea to name your functions. But, there are
certain situations where a short, anonymous function can make your code
easier to read and write.

For example, we earlier defined the \scalainline{doubleAll} function, which doubles
every number in a list of numbers. Here is simple, one-line definition
using an anonymous function as an argument to \scalainline{map}:

\begin{scalacode}
def doubleAll(alist: List[Int]) = map((n: Int) => n * 2, alist)
\end{scalacode}

The anonymous function itself is extremely simple and the name of the enclosing
function, \scalainline{doubleAll}, really makes it clear what it does.

For another example, suppose we want to remove all the odd numbers
in a list. We can do this using \scalainline{filter} and a short, anonymous function:

\begin{scalacode}
def removeOdds(alist: List[Int]) = filter((n: Int) => n % 2 == 0, alist)
\end{scalacode}

In these kinds of situations, anonymous functions can be very helpful.

\paragraph{Functions can be stored in data structures.}

The following datatype can stores two functions inside it:
%
\begin{scalacode}
case class Foo(m1: Int => Int, m2: Int => Int)
\end{scalacode}

We can create values of type \scalainline{Foo} in the following way:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val myFoo = Foo((x: Int) => x + 1, (y: Int) => y * 20)

assert(myFoo.m1(10) == 11)
assert(myFoo.m2(10) == 200)
\end{scalacode}
%
Admittedly, this isn't very useful, but notice that the function applications
look a lot like method calls.

\subsection{Some Definitions}

Here are some terminology that gets thrown around when comparing programming
languages and programming techniques.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Higher-order functions} are functions that consume or return other
  functions as values. You can tell if a function is higher-order by inspecting
  its type. Does it have any nested uses of \scalainline{=>} in the type? If so, it is a higher-order
  function.

  \item \emph{First-class functions} is a property of a programming language. For
  a programming language to have first-class functions, it must treat functions
  as values, with all the rights and privileges that other values have. You must
  be able to use functions as arguments, produce functions as results, and store
  functions in data-structures.

\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and Substitution\classtime{20}}

\paragraph{Global vs. Local Variables}

Why does the following program raise an error?

%
\begin{scalacode}
def f(x: Int) = {
  val y = x + 10
  y
}
f(11)
y
\end{scalacode}

Although the program defines a variable called \scalainline{y}, the
\emph{scope} of the variable is limited to the function \scalainline{f}.
Therefore, we cannot refer to the variable outside the function, which
is why we get an error.

\paragraph{Substitution}

What does the following program produce?
%
\begin{scalacode}
val x = 20
def f(x: Int): Int = {
  x + 5
}
f(10) + x
\end{scalacode}

The result is \scalainline{35}. Within the body of \scalainline{f}, the
the name \scalainline{x} refers to the argument to the function, which
\emph{shadows} the global variable \scalainline{val x = 20}. Therefore,
\scalainline{f(10) == 15}. However, outside the function \scalainline{x}
refers to the global variable \scalainline{x == 20}, and
\scalainline{15 + 20 == 35}.

We can make this argument more precise by \emph{substituting} variables
with their values:

\begin{itemize}

\item Given the orignal program above, we first substitute
the global \scalainline{x} with its value \scalainline{20}, to get
the following program:
\begin{scalacode}
def f(x: Int): Int = {
  x + 5
}
f(10) + 20
\end{scalacode}
%
Notice that we substituted the \scalainline{x} on the last line with \scalainline{20},
but left the \scalainline{x} within \scalainline{f} unchanged, since it referred
to the argument \scalainline{x}.

\item Next, we can apply the function \scalainline{f} by substituting
its argument \scalainline{x} with the value \scalainline{10}:
%
\begin{scalacode}
(10 + 5) + 20
\end{scalacode}

\item Finally, we are left with a simple arithmetic expression that is
trivial to evaluate.

\end{itemize}

Here is a more compact way of making the same argument:
%
\[
\small
\begin{array}{l|l|l}
 & \textrm{Expression} & \textrm{Reasoning} \\
\hline
& \lstinline[language=scala]|val x = 20; def f(x: Int): Int = { x + 5 }; f(10) + x|
& \textrm{Original expression} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|def f(x: Int): Int = { x + 5 }; f(10) + 20|
& \textrm{Substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|x| with \lstinline[language=scala]|20|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|(10 + 5) + 20|
& \textrm{Inline \lstinline[language=scala]|f| and substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|x| with \lstinline[language=scala]|10|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|15 + 20|
& \textrm{Evaluate \lstinline[language=scala]|10 + 5|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|35|
& \textrm{Evaluate \lstinline[language=scala]|15 + 20|}
\end{array}
\]

\paragraph{Nested Functions}
Scope can appear tricker when working with higher-order functions. But, we can
use the same substitution principle to reason about nested functions.

For example, we wrote the \scalainline{makeAdder} higher-order function before
and used it to create the \scalainline{add10} function:
\begin{scalacode}
def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = {
  def add(y): Int = { x + y }
  add
}

val add10 = makeAdder(10)
\end{scalacode}

The following calculate starts with the definition above (written in a single
line for brevity) and shows that it is equivalent to the more obvious
definition of \scalainline{add10}:
\[
\small
\begin{array}{l|l|l}
 & \textrm{Expression} & \textrm{Reasoning} \\
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{l}
{\lstinline[language=scala]|def makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int = { def add(y): Int = { x + y }; add }; val add10 = makeAdder(10)|}  \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = { def add(y): Int = { x + 10 }; add }|
& \textrm{Inline \lstinline[language=scala]|makeAdder| and substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|y| with
\lstinline[language=scala]|10|} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = { val add = ((y: Int) => { x + 10 }); add }| & \textrm{Rewrite \lstinline[language=scala]|add| using \lstinline[language=scala]|val| notation} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|val add10 = ((y: Int) => { x + 10 })|
& \textrm{Substitute \lstinline[language=scala]|add| with its definition} \\
= & \lstinline[language=scala]|def add10(y: Int) = x + 10|
& \textrm{Rewrite \lstinline[language=scala]|add| using \lstinline[language=scala]|def| notation}
\end{array}
\]

In fact, every line in this calculation is a valid Scala program (which you
should check!) and all the lines are truly equivalent to each other.

It is always possible to perform these kinds of calculations to simplify
expressions with higher-order functions. For large programs, a detailed
calculation may be infeasibly wrong. But, if you understand how these
calculuations work in detail on small programs, you'll be able to reason
carefully about larger programs without needing to actually do the calculuates
in detail.

\section{Storing Functions in Data Structures\classtime{25}}

Although we've seen that functions can be stored in data structures,
we haven't seen any good examples that suggest why we may want to do so.
For example, here is yet another type that stores functions in its
fields:
\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(
  getX: () => Double,
  getY: () => Double,
  magnitude: () => Double,
  add: Point => Point)
\end{scalacode}

Above, \scalainline{getX}, \scalainline{getY}, and \scalainline{magnitude}
are fields that store functions that consume zero arguments and produce
\scalainline{Double}s.

Consider the following higher-order function, which consumes two coordinates
and produces a point:
\begin{scalacode}
def makePoint(x: Double, y: Double): Point = {
  def getX(): Double = x
  def getY(): Double = y
  def magnitude(): Double = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
  def add(other: Point): Point = makePoint(x + other.getX(), y + other.getY())
  Point(getX, getY, magnitude, add)
}
\end{scalacode}

We can now construct points using \scalainline{makePoint}
and invoke the functions that it defines. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val pt1 = makePoint(3.0, 4.0)
assert(pt1.magnitude() == 5.0)
val pt2 = pt1.add(makePoint(10.0, 10.0))
assert(pt2.getX() == 13.0)
assert(pt1.getY() == 4.0)
\end{scalacode}

Note that this looks an awful lot like vanilla object-oriented programming.
In fact, you could say that \scalainline{makePoint} is a \emph{constructor}
that produces object that have the \emph{interface} \scalainline{Point}
and that \scalainline{getX}, \scalainline{getY}, etc. are \emph{methods} that the
interface defines.
Furthermore, \scalainline{x} and \scalainline{y} are \emph{private fields},
since they are not in scope outside the \scalainline{makePoint}
function.\footnote{However, \scalainline{x} and \scalainline{y} are in scope
for the methods, since they are local to \scalainline{makePoint}.}

This example shows that you can encode object-oriented programs using
higher-order functions. In fact, this example makes essential use of
scope, functions stored in data structures, functions that return
functions (stored in data structures), and all the other characteristics
of first-class functions. With just a little more effort, other object-oriented
ideas like inheritence can be encoded using higher-order functions too.
Conversely, it turns out that higher-order functions can be encoded using
objects, which we will see later in the course. The point of this exercise
is that functional programming and object-oriented programming are two sides
of the same coin.

\chapter{Handling Errors and the Option Type}
\savepdf{handling-errors-option-type}

\section{Required Reading}

Read Chapters 16 and 17 of \emph{Programming in Scala}.\footnote{The
  first edition is available online at
  \url{http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/}. The material in these chapters
  apply to the current version of Scala.} In Chapter 17, focus on
immutable collections. We will not use mutable collections in this class, so you can
skip reading about list buffers, array buffers, and arrays.

\section{Partial Functions and Signalling Errors}

\lstset{language=scala}
Many functions are not defined on all inputs. For example, if you're reading
input from a keyboard (i.e., a string) and want to parse the string as a
number, you can apply \lstinline|Integer.parseInt|:

\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val n = Integer.parseInt("10")
n: Int = 10
\end{lstlisting}

But, if the string is not a numeral, you get an exception:

\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val n = Integer.parseInt("ten")
java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "ten"
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=scala}
You've encountered other ways of signalling errors. For example, if you lookup
an unbound key in a hashtable, Java (and Scala) produce \lstinline|null|:

\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val ht = new java.util.Hashtable[Int, String]()
ht: java.util.Hashtable[Int,String] = {}
scala> ht.put(10, "hello")
scala> val r = ht.get(20)
r: String = null
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, here is a more insidious example. The following function calculates the
point where two lines, defined by $y = m_1 \cdot x + b_1$ and
$y = m2_ \cdot x + b_2$, intersect.
The function is not defined when the two lines are parallel (i.e., when their
slopes are the same, or $m_1 = m_2$):

\lstset{language=scala}
\begin{lstlisting}
 case class Point(x: Double, y: Double)

 def inter(m1: Double, b1: Double, m2: Double, b2: Double): Point = {
   val x = (b2 - b1) / (m1 - m2)
   Point(x, m1 * x + b1)
 }
\end{lstlisting}

When the slopes are the same, the denominator, \lstinline|m1 - m2| is
\lstinline|0|. So, you
might expect a divide-by-zero \lstinline|ArithmeticException|.
That's \emph{not}: what happens:
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> 1.0 / 0.0
res0: Double = Infinity
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=scala}
So you can't even catch this error with an exception handler, since no exception
is raised. In fact, the following interaction produces a \lstinline|NaN| value
(the number called ``not-a-number''):
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
scala> val r = inter(0, 0, 0, 0)
r: Point = Point(NaN,NaN)
\end{lstlisting}

All these mechanisms for signalling errors share similar flaws:
%
\begin{enumerate}

  \item \emph{Exceptions}: you have to remember to catch them, or your program will
   crash. You can't tell if a function will throw an exception without carefully
   reading its code, which may not even be possible if it is in a library.

  \item  \emph{Producing null}: even worse than exceptions, because your program
   will will \emph{not} crash on an error. When it does crash, you'll spend a
   lot of time trying to figure out what produced the \scalainline{null}.

   \item \emph{Producing other null-like values}: see above.

 \end{enumerate}

The real problem is that the types of all these functions are not useful:

\begin{itemize}

  \item The type of \scalainline{Integer.parseInt} is
  \scalainline{String => Int}, but it may throw an exception instead of producing an \scalainline{Int}.

  \item The type of \scalainline{ht.get} is \scalainline{Any => String}, but it
  may produce a \scalainline{null}.

  \item The type of \scalainline{inter} is \scalainline{(Double, Double, Double, Double) => Point},
  but it can produce \scalainline{Point(NaN, NaN)}, which is clearly not what we
  had in mind.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{A Solution}

Let's use \scalainline{inter} as an example and modify the function so that its type
makes it obvious that it may not always return a \scalainline{Point}. We introduce
the following sealed trait:

\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait OptionalPoint
case class SomePoint(pt: Point) extends OptionalPoint
case class NoPoint() extends OptionalPoint
\end{scalacode}

And we modify \scalainline{inter} to produce \scalainline{NoPoint} instead of a malformed-\scalainline{Point}:

\begin{scalacode}
def inter(m1: Double, b1: Double, m2: Double, b2: Double): OptionalPoint = {
  if (m1 - m2 == 0) {
    NoPoint()
  }
  else {
    val x = (m1 - m2) / (b2 - b1)
    Point(x, m1 * x + b1)
  }
}
\end{scalacode}

With this new type, any program that applies \scalainline{inter} will be forced to check if
a point was produced:

\begin{scalacode}
  inter(10, 3, 10, 3) match {
    case NoPoint => println("no intersection")
    case SomePoint(Point(x,y)) => println(s"intersection at ($x, $y)")
  }
\end{scalacode}

Consider another example: a type that represents an \emph{alarm clock}. An alarm
clock needs to track the current time and \emph{the alarm time if the alarm is set}:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Time(h: Int, m: Int, s: Int)
case class AlarmClock(time: Time, alarm: Time, alarmOn: Boolean)
\end{scalacode}

But, with this representation, it is easy to make simple errors. For example,
you may accidentally trigger the alarm when \scalainline{time == alarm}, if you forget
to check \scalainline{alarmOn} first. A cleaner represention is to use the same pattern we used
above:

\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait OptionalAlarm
case class NoAlarm() extends OPtionalAlarm
case class AlarmSet(time: Time) extends OptionalAlarm

case class AlarmClock(time: Time, alarm: OptionalAlarm)
\end{scalacode}

In both \scalainline{inter} and \scalainline{AlarmClock}, it is completely
obvious from the type that a point is not always produced and that an alarm is
not always set. Partial functions are \emph{pervasive} in computing and this pattern
will make your programs more robust.

But, it is annoying to define a new type such as \scalainline{OptionalPoint}
and \scalainline{OptionalAlarm} for each type.

\subsection{The Option Type}

Scala has a builtin generic type called \scalainline{Option} that abtracts the
pattern we discussed above. For example, here is \scalainline{inter} rewritten
to use \scalainline{Option}:

\begin{scalacode}
def inter(m1: Double, b1: Double, m2: Double, b2: Double): Option[Point] = {
  if (m1 - m2 == 0) {
    None
  }
  else {
    val x = (m1 - m2) / (b2 - b1)
    Some(Point(x, m1 * x + b1))
  }
}
\end{scalacode}

\section{Built-in List methods}

Scala's \scalainline{List} type has dozens of useful methods. For example,
these methods correspond to the higher-order functions we've seen so far:
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item We can map over a list:

  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(List(10, 20, 30).map(x => x + 1) == List(11, 21, 31))
  \end{scalacode}

  \item We can filter a list:

  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(List(1, 2, 3, 4).filter(x => x % 2 == 0) == List(2, 4))
  \end{scalacode}

  \item We can fold over a list:

  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(List(10, 20, 30).foldRight(0)((x, acc) => x + acc) == 60)
  \end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

Notice that the syntax of \scalainline{foldRight} is unusual. We'll get into the
details how it works later. For now, there is no need to write sums and products
using folds. Scala's lists have methods that do these directly:

\begin{scalacode}
assert(List(10, 20, 30).sum == 60)
assert(List(10, 20, 30).product == 6000)
\end{scalacode}

There are several other useful methods. For example:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \scalainline{alist.take(n)} produces a list with first \scalainline{n}
  elements of \scalainline{alist}. Similarly, \scalainline{alist.drop(n)} produces
  a list without the first \scalainline{n} elements of \scalainline{alist}.
  %
  \begin{scalacode}
  val alist = List("X", "Y", "Z", "A", "B", "C")
  assert(alist.take(3) == List("X", "Y", "Z"))
  assert(alist.drop(3) == List("A", "B", "C"))
  assert(alist.take(3) ::: alist.drop(3) == alist)
  \end{scalacode}

  In the last line, the \scalainline{:::} operator (pronounced ``append'')
  appends two lists.

  \begin{notation}
  We emphasize that \scalainline{:::} is an ordinary method,
  even though it is written using funny symbols and appears to be an infix
  operator. We could append lists using conventional method-application
  syntax:
  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(alist.:::(alist) == alist ::: alist)
  \end{scalacode}
  In fact, all operators on objects are actually ordinary methods. E.g.,
  we could write \scalainline{2.+(3.*(6))}, to do arithmetic using
  conventional method-application syntax. However, the usual notation
  of \scalainline{2 + (3 * 6)} is typically easier to read.

  \end{notation}

  \item \scalainline{alist.exists(f)} produces \scalainline{true} if there
  exists any element in the list on which \scalainline{f} produces
  \scalainline{true}.

  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(List(1, 2, 3, 4).exists(n => n == 2) == true)
  assert(List(1, 2, 3, 4).exists(n => n == 5) == false)
  \end{scalacode}

  \item \scalainline{alist.forall(f)} checks that all elements in \scalainline{alist}
  satisfy \scalainline{f}:
  %
  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(List(2, 4, 6, 8).forall(x => x % 2 == 0) == true)
  assert(List(2, 3, 4).forall(x => x % 2 == 0) == false)
  \end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

There are several other useful functions. You should explore the
\href{http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.7/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.List}{List API} to learn more about them.

\section{Sets and Maps}

\paragraph{Sets}
%
The Scala standard library also defines sets and maps, which are two other data
structures that are very common. Note that these represent mathematical sets, so
they don't have duplicate elements and are not ordered. i.e., the three
definitions below are the same:
%
\begin{scalacode}
Set(1, 2, 3)
Set(1, 2, 2, 3)
Set(3, 2, 1)
\end{scalacode}

Sets have methods for calculating set union, set intersection, set difference,
testing emptiness, and so on:
%
\begin{scalacode}
assert(Set(1, 2, 3).union(Set(2, 3, 4)) == Set(1, 2, 3, 4))
assert(Set(1, 2, 3).intersect(Set(2, 3, 4)) == Set(2, 3))
assert(Set(1, 2).intersect(Set(3, 4)).isEmpty == true)
\end{scalacode}

We can also map and filter the elements of sets, similar to lists:
%
\begin{scalacode}
assert(Set(1, 2, 3, 4).filter(x => x % 2 == 0) == Set(2, 4))
assert(Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map(x => x % 2) = Set(0, 1))
\end{scalacode}

There are severy other useful methods in the
\href{http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.7/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Set}{Set API}.

\paragraph{Maps}
The Map data-structure (which is not the same as the map function) is a finite
map from keys to values. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
val dueDates = Map(
  1 -> "Jan 28",
  2 -> "Feb 4",
  3 -> "Feb 11")
\end{scalacode}

\begin{notation}
\scalainline{X -> Y} is just another notation for the tuple
\scalainline{(X, Y)}, but is commonly used with maps to suggest that it
``maps X to Y''. Therefore, we could have writen
\begin{scalacode}
val dueDates = Map(
  (1, "Jan 28"),
  (2, "Feb 4"),
  (3, "Feb 11"))
\end{scalacode}
\end{notation}

We can lookup a key in two ways. First, we can simply apply the map to a key,
just like a function:
\begin{scalacode}
assert(dueDates(1) == "Feb 4")
\end{scalacode}

However, if the key is not found, this throws an exception. An alternative
is to apply the get methods, which produces \scalainline{Some(v)} if the
key is mapped to a value and \scalainline{None} otherwise:
%
\begin{scalacode}
dueDates.get(x) match {
  case Some(v) => v
  case None => "Unknown assignment"
\end{scalacode}

We can augment maps using the following syntax:
\begin{scalacode}
val moreDueDates = dueDates + (4 -> "Feb 18")
\end{scalacode}
We emphasize that this produces a new map with all the contents of
\scalainline{dueDates} and the key mapping for \scalainline{4}.
The original map is not modified.

\begin{notation}
The notation \scalainline{m + (k -> v)} seems to be something
new, but we know how to unpack it. We just learned the arrow notation is
another way of writing tuples, we can first rewrite it as \scalainline{m + (k, v)}.
We also learned that all operators on objects are actually methods, so
can rewrite it again as \scalainline{m.+((k, v))}.

Therefore, we can conclude that maps have a method called \scalainline{+} that
takes one argument. This argument is a tuple where the first component is a key
\scalainline{k} and the second component is the value \scalainline{v}. The
result of applying this method is a new map where \scalainline{k} is mapped to
\scalainline{v}.
\end{notation}

It is often get the set of keys in a map:
\begin{scalacode}
assert(dueDates.keys == Set(1, 2, 3))
\end{scalacode}

Similarly, we can get an \emph{iterator} over the values. Typically, you'll
want to turn the iterator into a list immediately:
\begin{scalacode}
assert(dueDates.values.toList == List("Jan 28", "Feb 4", "Feb 11"))
\end{scalacode}

As usual, there are dozens of handy methods over maps. You should
explore the \href{http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.7/index.html#scala.collection.Map}{Map API}.

\section{Conversions}

It is sometimes necssary and easy to convert lists, sets, and maps to each
other. These objects have methods called \scalainline{toList},
\scalainline{toSet}, and \scalainline{toMap} that do exactly what their
names suggest. For example:
%
\begin{scalacode}
assert(Map("X" -> 10, "Y" -> 20).toList == List(("X", 10), ("Y", 20)))
assert(List(("X", 10), ("Y", 20)).toMap == Map("X" -> 10, "Y" -> 20))
\end{scalacode}

\chapter{Shell Scripting and Function Composition}
\savepdf{shell-scripting-and-composition}

In this chapter, we will first take a small detour from Scala to learn basic
\emph{shell scripting}. Shell scripts let you quickly automate repetitive tasks
that frequently occur while programming. Therefore, knowing how to write shell
scripts will make you a better programmer. Once we are done with shell
scripting, we will study the design principles that underly shell scripting,
known as \emph{combinators}, and see that they are applicable to a wide variety
of problems.

\section{Shell Scripting}

- We've seen basics, e.g., to change directory, remove files, etc.

- Many more commands: cat, sort, uniq, cut, grep, paste, head, tail

- Redirecting standard out, e.g., ls > foo/bar

- Redirecting standard in, e.g., 

  sort < /filename

- Pipes

  sort file > out; head -n 5 out 

   OR

  sort file | head -n 5


- Command-line arguments vs. standard in

- Example:

  - Getting student participation IDs out of a moodle.csv

    cut -f 1 -d , | cut -f 2 -d ' '

  - Creating directories for each student

    cut -f 1 -d , | cut -f 2 -d ' ' | xargs mkdir

  - Compile everyone's project

    ls | xargs (cd {}; sbt build)

  - Tackle errors:

    ls | xargs (cd {}; sbt build || echo "Error building project")

\section{Programming with Combinators}

- define a class for operations String => List[String] and a
  sequencing >>> operation
  val numHi = words <input> >> filter (x => x == "hi") >> length

- Why not just use objects? Answer: this way we can define new operations

- Introduce the split combinator

Programming in Scala, Chapter 6.1---6.11.\footnote{\url{http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/}}

\section{Object Oriented Scala}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{scalacode}
class Point(x: Double, y: Double) {

  def getX() = this.x

  def getY() = this.y

  def add(other: Point) = {
    new Point(this.x + other.getX(),
              this.y + other.getY())
  }

  def magnitude() = math.sqrt(x * x + y + y)
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{A class for points.}\label{pointclass}
\end{minipage}
\quad\vrule\quad
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{javacode}
class Point {
  private Double x;
  private Double y;

  public Point(Double x, Double y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  public Double getX() {
    return this.x;
  }

  public Double getY() {
    return this.y;
  }

  public Point add(Point other) {
    return new Point(this.x + other.getX(),
                     this.y + other.getY());
  }

  public Double magnitude() = {
    return math.sqrt(x * x + y + y);
  }
}
\end{javacode}
\caption{A similar class in Java.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Although we've focused on functional programming so far, Scala supports
Java-style object-oriented programming too. For example, \cref{pointclass}
defines a \scalainline{Point} class (not a case class) with two private
fields\footnote{Recall that case class fields are public, which
is what allows us to use pattern matching. We cannot pattern match on ordinary classes,
even if their fields are public.} and four methods.

Notice that we didn't have to declare a constructor for \scalainline{Point}.
Scala creates a constructor automatically that initializes the values of
\scalainline{x} and \scalainline{y}.

We could make the fields public by writing:
\begin{scalacode}
class Point(val x: Double, val y: Double) { ... }
\end{scalacode}

We can make methods private by writing:
\begin{scalacode}
private def add(other: Point) = { ... }
\end{scalacode}

If we wanted to compute the value of a field, e.g., if we wanted the magnitude
to be a field whose value is calculated at construction, we could write:
%
\begin{scalacode}
class Point(x: Double, y: Double) {

  val magnitute = math.sqrt(x * x + y + y)

  ...
}
\end{scalacode}

In fact, you can think of the entire body of the class as the constructor.
For example, the following code prints each time a new point is constructed:

%
\begin{scalacode}
class Point(x: Double, y: Double) {

  println(s"Created a new Point with x = $x and y = $y.")

  ...
}
\end{scalacode}

These and other features of Scala's classes are described in depth in the
assigned reading. However, note that they are mostly syntactic differences.
The semantics of classes in Scala and Java are exactly the same (for now).

\section{Converting Functional Code to Object-Oriented Code}

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait Shape
case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape // Center of the circle is (0, 0)
case class Square(side: Double) extends Shape // Bottom-left corner of the square is (0, 0)

object Shape {
  def inShape(s: Shape, x: Double, y: Double) = s match {
    case Circle(radius) => math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) <= radius
    case Square(side) => x >= 0 && x <= side && y >= 0 && y <= side
  }
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{A Functional Shape Library}
\label{fshapes1}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fshapes1} shows a library for shapes, written in a functional style.
The library defines a sealed trait called \scalainline{Shape} and two
constructors for \scalainline{Circle} and \scalainline{Square} using
case classes. The library defines a function called \scalainline{inShape}
to test whether an $(x,y)$ coordinate is within the given shape. The function
uses pattern-matching to handle the two cases for circles and squares.

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
trait Shape {
  def inShape(x: Double, y: Double) = {
    if (this.isInstanceOf[Circle]) {
      math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) <= this.asInstanceOf[Circle].radius
    }
    else if (this.isInstanceOf[Square]) {
      val side = this.asInstanceOf[Square].side
      x >= 0 && x <= side && y >= 0 && y <= side
    }
    else {
      sys.error("unknown shape!")
    }
  }
}
class Circle(val radius: Double) extends Shape
class Square(val side: Double) extends Shape
\end{scalacode}
\caption{An object-oriented shape library: do not write code like this.}
\label{jshapesbad}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Object-Oriented Refactoring Done Badly} To refactor this code into an
object-oriented style, we need to stop using case classes and pattern matching
and turn \scalainline{inShape} into a method instead of a function.
A literal translation of the code would be to turn the case classes
into classes with public fields, move the method into the \scalainline{Shape}
trait,\footnote{Think of this trait as an abstract class in Java. Traits are actually more powerful, but we'll get to that later.}, and rewrite the body to
use type-tests and casts.
 \Cref{jshapesbad} shows this refactoring of the
code.

\begin{notation}
In Scala:
\begin{scalacode}
this.instanceOf[Circle]
\end{scalacode}
is the same as
\javainline{this instanceof Circle} in Java.

In Scala:
\begin{scalacode}
this.asInstanceOf[Square]
\end{scalacode}
is the same as \javainline{(Square)this} in Java.
\end{notation}

You should already know that this is terrible code! It is an extremely bad idea
to use \javainline{instanceof} and type-casts in Java (and in Scala) because it
\emph{defeats the type system}. The point of the type system in Java (and Scala)
is to help you catch errors. When you write code like this, the type system
can't help you.
\textbf{You are not permitted to use \scalainline{isInstanceOf} and \scalainline{asInstanceOf},
since writing high-quality code is a major goal of this class.}

\paragraph{Object Oriented Refactoring Done Right}

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
trait Shape {
  def inShape(x: Double, y: Double): Boolean
}

class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape {
   def inShape(x: Double, y: Double) = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y) <= radius
}

class Square(side: Double) extends Shape {
  def inShape(x: Double, y: Double) = x >= 0 && x <= side && y >= 0 && y <= side
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{An object-oriented shape library done well.}
\label{jshapes1}
\end{figure}

The right way to build an object-oriented shape library is shown in \Cref{jshapes1}.
We've made
\scalainline{inShape} an abstract method in the trait
\scalainline{Shape}\footnote{Now, we're using the trait like an interface
in Java.} and each shape provides
an implementation. Note that we are not using any type-casts or type-tests and
that the shapes' fields are private, which is typically good practice in
object-oriented code. \textbf{Most significantly,} notice that the method
bodies are exactly the same as the cases in the function from \cref{fshapes1}.

Functional code that uses pattern matching can be converted to equivalent
object-oriented code by following this recipe:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Functions that use pattern-matching become abstract methods on the type
  on which they pattern match.

  i.e., a function that looks like this:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def f(x: T, args ...): R = x match { ... }
  \end{scalacode}

  Becomes an abstract method:

  \begin{scalacode}
  trait T {
    def f(args ...): R
  }
  \end{scalacode}

  \begin{think}
  Notice that the \emph{function} $f$ takes an argument caled $x$, but
  the \emph{method} $f$ does not. Why not?
  \end{think}

  \item Each case in a function turns into an implementation of the abstract
  method in the corresponding class.

  i.e., a function that has a case like this:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def f(x: T, args ...): R = x match {
    case C(fields ...) => body
  }
  \end{scalacode}

  Becomes an implementation of the method $f$:

  \begin{scalacode}
  class C(fields ...) extends T {

    def f(args ...): R = body
  }
  \end{scalacode}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{think}
A key feature of pattern-matching is the \emph{exhuastivity check}. If
we forget to write a case in a function, Scala complains that pattern-matching
may not be exhaustive and actually lists all the cases that we have not
handled. Since we are no longer using pattern-matching, we no longer rely
on exhuastivity-checking. Is this okay? How do similar bugs manifest in
object-oriented code and can the Scala compiler catch them?
\end{think}

\section{Using Libraries}

Libraries and APIs are an important part of programming. Without libraries,
we'd be writing a lot of basic functionality from scratch. The Scala
and Java \emph{standard libraries} define a variety of useful data structures
and programming patterns and are available to all code that you write.
SBT makes it easy to use libraries from the Web.

For example,
\href{https://lihaoyi.github.io/upickle-pprint/upickle/}{uPickle} is a
handy library for converting Scala data structures to JSON, which is
often used in systems where programs in several languages need to communicate.
To use uPickle in a project, create a file called \texttt{build.sbt} in the
root directory of the project and add the line:
%
\begin{scalacode}
libraryDependencies += "com.lihaoyi" %% "upickle" % "0.3.8"
\end{scalacode}
%
After restarting SBT, you can use uPickle as documented on its website.
\href{http://mvnrepository.com}{Maven Central} has thousands of libraries
that you can use in a similar way.

\section{Writing Libraries}

Any SBT project can be packaged into a library by simply giving it
a name, organization, and version number in the \texttt{build.sbt} file.
For example, we could use the following \texttt{build.sbt} for our
functional shape library:

\begin{scalacode}
name := "fshapes"
organization := "compsci220"
version := "1.0"
\end{scalacode}

Before publishing a library on the Web, it is a good idea to test it by
publishing it locally. We can run \texttt{sbt publish-local} to do so.

When it completes, we can test the library by using it from another
project. To do so, we'd have to add this line to its \texttt{build.sbt}
file:
\begin{scalacode}
libraryDependencies += "compsci220" %% "fshapes" % "1.0"
\end{scalacode}

It takes a little more work to publish libararies online.
If you want to learn how to do so, we recommend using
\href{https://github.com/softprops/bintray-sbt}{Bintray SBT}. (It is a lot
simpler than using Maven Central directly.)

\section{Reusing and Extending Libraries}

Imagine that we wanted to use a library of shapes and we'd found both the functional
and object-oriented shape library we wrote earlier on the Web. We can use
either one by editing the \texttt{build.sbt} file:

\begin{scalacode}
libraryDependencies += "compsci220" %% "fshapes" % "1.0"
\end{scalacode}
or
\begin{scalacode}
libraryDependencies += "compsci220" %% "jshapes" % "1.0"
\end{scalacode}

So, which one should we use? Recall that both libraries implement the same
features: only two shapes and just one method/function to calculate if
a point is within a shape. So, perhaps the choice is just a matter of taste:
i.e., whether we prefer to think functionally or in an object-oriented way.

But, let's consider the choices more carefully. In particular, suppose neither
library was quite right and we needed to extend them in some way. In fact,
our libraries are so small, it's easy to imagine that we'd want a larger
variety of shapes and other functions or methods. So, let's see what it
takes to extend each library.

Remember that these are meant to be libraries that someone else wrote that
we are re-using in our own project. So, we do not want to read or modify their code. (Imagine that
the library has millions of lines of code). In fact, it may be a closed-source
library, so the original code may not even be available for us to read or modify.
So, imagine that all we have to work with is the Scaladoc and some example code.

We'll consider two kinds of extensions:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Extending the data model} by adding support for rectangles.

  \item \emph{Extending the feature set} by adding a routine to
  double the size of a shape.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extending the Functional Shape Library}

It is easy to write a new function to double the size of a shape. In our
own project, we could simply write:

\begin{scalacode}
object FunctionalExtension {
  def growShape(s: Shape): Shape = s match {
    case Circle(radius) => Circle(radius * 2)
    case Square(side) => Square(side * 2)
  }
}
\end{scalacode}

Now, let's add support for rectangles. The obvious thing to do is write:
\begin{scalacode}
import fshapes._
case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape
\end{scalacode}
But, this code does not type-check, because \scalainline{Shape} was \emph{sealed}
earlier. This may appear annoying now, but its a good thing that it doesn't work.
Remember that the \scalainline{inShape} function in the library doesn't
have a case for \scalainline{Rectangle}. How could it? Someone else wrote it
and didn't anticipate that we wanted support for rectangles. Therefore, by
preventing us from extending \scalainline{Shape}, Scala is ensuring that
the library code doesn't fail. (i.e., Scala is ensuring that the exhuastivity
analysis it did on the library remains valid.)

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
sealed trait ShapeExt
case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends ShapeExt
case class OtherShape(s: Shape) extends ShapeExt

object FunctionalExtension {
  def growShape(s: ShapeExt): ShapeExt = s match {
    case OtherShape(Circle(radius)) => OtherShape(Circle(radius * 2))
    case OtherShape(Square(side)) => OtherShape(Square(side * 2))
    case Rectangle(width, height) => Rectangle(width * 2, height * 2)
  }

  def inShape(s: ShapeExt, x: Double, y: Double): Boolean = s match {
    case OtherShape(shape) => Shape.inShape(shape, x, y)
    case Rectangle(width, height) => x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x <= width && y <= height
  }
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{Extending fshapes with rectangles.}
\label{fshapesext}
\end{figure}

However, all is not lost. We can add support for rectangles by \emph{wrapping}
the previously defined \scalainline{Shape} type in a new type. \Cref{fshapesext}
shows how to do this. The idea is quite straightforward. We simply
have to define a new \scalainline{inShape} function that handles rectangles
and invokes the original \scalainline{inShape} function on other shapes.

Now, imagine doing this on a large library with hundreds of functions. It would
be extremely tiresome. But, this illustrates a \emph{fundamental limitation of
functional programming}: it is easy to extends a library by adding new
functions, but it is hard to extend a library to support new kinds of data.

\begin{think}
Imagine that the original library had a \scalainline{growShape} function
and that we were trying to write the \scalainline{inShape} function.
Would wrapping still work?

Suppose the original library had a constructor for creating composite
shapes:
\begin{scalacode}
case class Overlay(top: Shape, bottom: Shape) extends Shape
\end{scalacode}
Would wrapping still work?
\end{think}

\subsection{Extending the Object-Oriented Shape Library}

It is easy to extend the object-oriented library with rectangles. All we
have to do is create a new class that extends \scalainline{Shape}
and define its \scalainline{inShape} method:
%
\begin{scalacode}
class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape {
  def inShape(x: Double, y: Double): Boolean = x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x <= width && y <= height
}
\end{scalacode}

Now, let's try to add a feature to double the size of shapes. The object-oriented
way is to have a \scalainline{growShape} method in the \scalainline{Shape}
trait. But, we can't do that because \scalainline{Shape} was defined in
a library that someone else wrote (and we don't have the source code).

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
object JShapesExtension {
  def growShape(shape: Shape) {
    if (this.isInstanceOf[Circle]) {
      new Circle(this.asInstanceOf[Circle].radius * 2)
    }
    else if (this.isInstanceOf[Square]) {
      new Square(this.asInstanceOf[Square].side * 2)
    }
    else if (this.isInstanceOf[Rectangle]) {
      new Rectangle(this.asInstanceOf[Rectangle].width * 2, this.asInstanceOf[Rectangle].height * 2)
    }
    else {
      sys.error("unknown shape!")
    }
  }
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{Using type-tests and type-casts to grow shows. Does not compile.}
\label{jshapesext1}
\end{figure}

Instead, we could write a \scalainline{growShape} function using
type-tests and type-casts, as shown in \cref{jshapesext1}. We've already
discussed why this is terrible code. Moreover, it has a simpler problem: it
does not compile.

\begin{think}
Why doesn't the code in \cref{jshapesext1} compile?
\end{think}

\begin{figure}
\begin{scalacode}
trait Growable {
  def growShape(): Shape
}

class MyCircle(radius: Double) extends Circle(radius) with Growable {
  def growShape(): MyCircle = new MyCircle(radius * 2)
}

class MySquare(side: Double) extends Square(side) with Growable {
  def growShape(): MySquare = new MySquare(side * 2)
}

class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape with Growable {
  def inShape(x: Double, y: Double: Boolean = x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x <= width && y <= height

  def growShape(): Rectangle = new Rectangle(width * 2, height * 2)
}
\end{scalacode}
\caption{Using inheritance to extend the library.}
\label{jshapesext2}
\end{figure}

An alternative approach uses inheritance, as shown
in \cref{jshapesext2}. The key idea is to create  new types for circles
and squares that inherit from the existing libraries.
Again, imagine doing this at scale: if the library had dozens of objects
and dozens of methods, this would be extremely tedious.
 This illustrates a \emph{fundamental limitation of
object-oriented programming}: it is easy to extends a library with new
kinds of data (new classes), but it is hard to extend a library to support
new methods.

\begin{think}
Suppose the original library had a class that represented composite
shapes:
\begin{scalacode}
class Overlay(top: Shape, bottom: Shape) extends Shape { ... }
\end{scalacode}
Would wrapping work?
\end{think}

\section{Perspective}

These two examples illustrate that functional
and object-oriented styles involve fundamental tradeoffs when it comes
to extending and re-using code. There are certain kinds of extensions
that can be done in object-oriented style that cannot be done in
functional style, and vice versa.  It is misguided to argue that
one style is better than the other. What matters is how you expect your code
to be used (and extended). One could argue that a language that forces you to
pick one style of programming limits the kinds of code re-use that are possible.

\chapter{Project: Data Wrangling with Json}
\savepdf{project-json-data-wrangling}

\section{Background}

\emph{JavaScript Object Notation} (JSON) is format storing and
exchanging data. It originated from JavaScript, but it is now supported by
almost every programming language, including Scala. JSON is designed
to be human-readable. For example, the following text is JSON:
%
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
[
  {
    "Department": "Computer Science",
    "Course Number": 220,
    "Instructor": "Arjun Guha",
    "Offered": true
  },
  {
    "Department": "Computer Science",
    "Course Number": 631,
    "Instructor": "Arjun Guha",
    "Offered": false
  }
]
\end{lstlisting}
%
This example shows a JSON array with two elements, where each element is a
JSON dictionary. Each JSON dictionary has a set of keys---which are strings---and
values---which are JSON values themselves. The example shows that JSON values include
strings, numbers, and booleans. Note that arrays and objects are JSON values
themselves. Therefore, arrays and dictionary may be nested:
\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}
[
  {
    "x": {
      "y": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    }
  },
  "Something else"
]
\end{lstlisting}
%
The example above also shows that JSON arrays may be \emph{heterogenous}:
the two elements of the array are an object and a string.
Finally, JSON has a special value called \lstinline|null|.

\lstset{language=scala}
To work with a JSON file in Scala, we need to first read it (as a string)
and turn it into a data structure. The course library defines
a type called \lstinline|Json| and a function to read JSON files:
\begin{lstlisting}
import hw.json._

val result: Json = JsonHelper.parse("yelp.json")
\end{lstlisting}
%
The type \lstinline|JSON| is a \lstinline|sealed trait| with a
\lstinline|case class| for each type of JSON value:
\begin{lstlisting}
sealed trait Json
case class JsonNull() extends Json
case class JsonNumber(value: Double) extends Json
case class JsonString(value: String) extends Json
case class JsonBool(value: Boolean) extends Json
case class JsonDict(value: Map[JsonString, Json]) extends Json
case class JsonArray(value: List[Json]) extends Json
\end{lstlisting}

Note that you should not define these types yourself. They are part of the
\lstinline|hw.json| package. All the case class and functions are documented in
the \emph{Course package documentation} link on Moodle.

\section{The Yelp Dataset}

The restaurant review site Yelp releases a large dataset of restaurants
(and other businesses) in a
JSON format. In this assignment, you will use this dataset to answer vital
questions such as \emph{``What is the most popular restaurant in
California?''}. Unfortunately, the full dataset is nearly 7GB, which is too
large for most computers. Therefore, you will instead use a subset of the Yelp
data. Each review is a JSON object that looks like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "name": "Jade Palace",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "state": "CA",
    "stars": 4.5,
    "review_count": 1140,
    "attributes": { ... },
    "categories": [ "Chinese", "TakeOut" ],
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Preliminaries}

Using the command-line, run the command
\verb|sbt new umass-compsci220/scala-json-data-wrangling.g8|. When prompted for
a project name, press ``Enter'' to accept the default name. This will create
a directory called \verb|scala-json-data-wrangling|.
You also need to download \verb|yelp.json| from the assignment page
and place it in the project directory.


\section{Programming Task}


Within the file \verb|scala-json-data-wrangling/src/main/scala/Main.scala|,
implement the following functions:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Write a function that takes a key as an argument and produces the
    value associated with that key. If the provided argument is not a JSON
    dictory, or if the key does not exist, the function should produce
    \lstinline|None|.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def key(json: Json, key: String): Option[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item \textbf{(Covered in discussion.)} Write a function that consumes a
    list of restaurants and only produces reviews of restaurants in the given
    state.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def fromState(data: List[Json], state: String): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Write a function that consumes a list of restaurants and only
    produces those restaurants that are rated less than
    or equal to \lstinline|rating|.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def ratingLT(data: List[Json], rating: Double): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Write a function that consumes a list of restaurants
    and returns only those restaurants that are rated greater than
    or equal to \lstinline|rating|.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def ratingGT(data: List[Json], rating: Double): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Write a function that consumes a list of rrestaurants
     and produces only those restaurants
    that have the given category.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def category(data: List[Json], category: String): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item \textbf{(Covered in discussion.)} Write a function that consumes a
    list of restaurants and returns a \lstinline|Map| from states to
    restaurants in that state.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def groupByState(data: List[Json]): Map[String, List[Json]]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Write a function that consumes a list of restaurants and returns a
    map from categories to restaurants in that category.
    \textbf{Note:} If a rerestaurant has multiple categories, it should
    occur multiple times in the output.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def groupByCategory(data: List[Json]): Map[String, List[Json]]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Write a function that consumes a list of restaurants and returns the
    ``best'' restaurant. The ``best'' restaurant is has the highest rated
    restaurant. If there is a tie, pick the one with the most reviews.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def bestPlace(data: List[Json]): Option[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item Each restaurant record contains an \texttt{attributes} key that
    \textit{may} contain an \texttt{Ambience} key, which
    itself is an object:
    \begin{scalacode}
    {   ...
        "attributes": {
            ...
            "Ambience": {
                "hipster": false,
                "trendy": false,
                "upscale": false,
                "casual": false
            }
        }
    }
    \end{scalacode}
    Write a function that consumes a list of restaurants and produces those
    restaurants that have the given ambience.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def hasAmbience(data: List[Json], ambience: String): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

    \item \textbf{(Not graded.)} There
    is no way to uniquely identify the restaurants in the dataset. 
    Write a function that adds a
    new key called \verb|uid| to every restaurant record.
    \begin{scalacode}
    def addUid(json: List[Json]): List[Json]
    \end{scalacode}

\end{enumerate}

You'll notice that many of the functions produce a list of JSON
objects. The key idea is that you can compose these functions together to
pose complex queries. For example, suppose \texttt{yelpJson} holds the
complete yelp data.

\begin{itemize}
\item The following query finds the best takeout restaurant in California:
    \begin{scalacode}
    bestPlace(category(fromState(yelpJson, "CA"), "takeout"))
    \end{scalacode}

\item The following query finds the best establishment in each state:
    \begin{scalacode}
    groupByState(yelpJson).map((state, els) => (s, best(els)))
    \end{scalacode}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Project: List Processing}
\savepdf{project-list-processing}

This assignment has several ``finger exercises'' that introduce you
to functional programming in Scala.

\section{Setup}

Before you start programming, you need to complete a few preliminary steps.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Follow the directions on the course website to install Scala and SBT.

\item Using the command-line, run the command
\verb|sbt new umass-compsci220/scala-list-processing.g8|. When prompted for
a project name, press ``Enter'' to accept the default name.
This will create a directory called \verb|scala-list-processing|. 

\item To verify that the previous step worked, enter the directory from
the command-line using the command \verb|cd scala-list-processing|
and then run the command \verb|sbt test|. You should
see output that looks like this:

\lstset{language=console}
\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=scala}

\noindent \emph{There should be no errors or warnings printed.}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercises}

For this assignment, you'll be write several list-processing
functions. You must place these within the \verb|Lists| object in the
file \verb|src/main/scala/Lists.scala|.
You must write tests cases, within the \verb|TestSuite|
class, which is in the file \verb|src/test/scala/Tests.scala|.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{sumDouble} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[Int]} and produces an \scalainline{Int}. The produced
  value should be double the sum of the list of integers.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{removeZeroes} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[Int]} and produces a \scalainline{List[Int]}.
  The produced list should be the same as the input list, but with all zeroes
  removed. The function must not change the order of elements.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{countEvens} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[Int]} and produces an \scalainline{Int} that represents
  that number of even numbers in the input list.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{removeAlternating} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[String]} and produces a \scalainline{List[String]} that
  has every other element in the input list.

  The first element of the input list must be in the output list.
  For example:
  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(removeAlternating(List("A", "B")) == List("A"))
  assert(removeAlternating(List("A", "B")) != List("B"))
  \end{scalacode}

  The function must not change the order of elments.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{isAscending} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[Int]} and produces a \scalainline{Boolean} that is
  \scalainline{true} if the numbers in the input list are in ascending order.
  Note that the input may have repeated numbers.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{addSub} that consumes a
  \scalainline{List[Int]} and produces an \scalainline{Int}. The
  function should add all the elements in even position and subtract all the
  elements in odd position.

  Note that the first element of a list is considered
  ``zeroth'' element, thus it is in even position.
  For example, \scalainline{addSub(List(10, 20, 30, 40))} should be
  \scalainline{10 - 20 + 30 - 40}.

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{alternate} that consumes \emph{two}
  \scalainline{List[Int]} arguments and produces a \scalainline{List[Int]}.
  The elements of the resulting list should alternate between the elements of
  the arguments. You may assume that the two arguments have the same
  length.

  For example:

  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(alternate(List(1, 3, 5), List(2, 4, 6)) == List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
  \end{scalacode}

  \item Write a function called \scalainline{fromTo} that takes
  two \scalainline{Int}s as arguments and produces a \scalainline{List[Int]}.
  The value of \scalainline{fromTo(x, y)} should be the list of consecutive
  integers that start from and include $x$, going up to and excluding $y$.
  You may assume that $x < y$.

  For example:
  \begin{scalacode}
  assert(fromTo(9, 13) == List(9, 10, 11, 12))
  \end{scalacode}

  \item Write the following function:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def insertOrdered(n: Int, lst: List[Int]): List[Int]
  \end{scalacode}

  Assuming that \scalainline{lst} is in ascending order,
  \scalainline{insertOrdered} should produce a list that is the same as
  the input, but with $n$ inserted such that the order is preserved.
  For example, \scalainline{insertOrdered(5, List(1, 3, 7, 9))} should be
  \scalainline{List(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)}.

  You should assume that \scalainline{lst} is in ascending order. Your function
   may produce any result or even throw an exception if it is not.

   \item Write the following function:

   \begin{scalacode}
   def sort(lst: List[Int]): List[Int]
   \end{scalacode}

   The result should be the sorted input list.

   \item \textbf{Not graded.} Write a function called \lstinline|allLT|
   that consumes a list of integers and a value $n$ and produces all the numbers
   in the list that are less than $n$.

   \item \textbf{Not graded.} Write a function called \lstinline|allGTE|
   that consumes a list of integers and a value $n$ and produces all the numbers
   in the list that are greater than or equal $n$.

   \item \textbf{Not graded.} Use the two functions that you wrote above
   to implement the following function:

\chapter{Project: Higher-Order Functions}
\savepdf{project-higher-order-functions}

In this assignment, you'll write several higher-order functions over lists.

\textbf{Restrictions}: You must not use Scala's builtin methods. In particular, you must not
use any of the methods on Scala's lists. However, feel free to use any of the list-processing
functions that we've written in class or the code you wrote for the previous assignment.
You
may not use imperative features, such as \scalainline{while} and \scalainline{var}.
You should also write any helper functions you think are necessary. You
may also use functions you write for one part of the assignment to solve
another part of the assignment.

\section{Preliminaries}

Using the command-line, run the command
\verb|sbt new umass-compsci220/scala-higher-order-functions.g8|. When prompted for
a project name, press ``Enter'' to accept the default name.

Within the file \verb|scala-higher-order-functions/src/main/scala/Main.scala|,
implement the following functions.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Write the \scalainline{map2} function, which maps over two lists:

\begin{scalacode}
def map2[A,B,C](f: (A, B) => C, alist1: List[A], alist2: List[B]): List[C]
\end{scalacode}

You may assume that \scalainline{alist1} and \scalainline{alist2} have the same
length. (i.e., do whatever you think is reasonable if they have different
lengths).

\item
Scala lets you write \scalainline{(x, y)} to create \emph{tuples}. For example:

\begin{scalacode}
val nameSsn: (String, Int) = ("John Smith", 19970293)
val emailAdmin: (String, Boolean) = ("carberry@cs.umass.edu", true)
val xy: (Double, Double) = (3.0, 4.0)
\end{scalacode}

Tuples are a convenient way to package two related values together, without
having to create a new type to hold them. You can use pattern matching to
extract the components of tuples, or simply write \scalainline{xy._1}
and \scalainline{xy._2} to access the first and second component respectively.

Write the \scalainline{zip} function, which tuples corresponding elements in a list:

\begin{scalacode}
def zip[A,B](alist1: List[A], alist2: List[B]): List[(A, B)]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the function \scalainline{flatten}, which flattens a nested list:

\begin{scalacode}
def flatten[A](alist: List[List[A]]): List[A]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{flatten3} function, which flattens a triple-nested list:

\begin{scalacode}
def flatten3[A](alist: List[List[List[A]]]): List[A]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{buildList} function, which builds a list of the given length. Each
element is determined by applying \scalainline{f} to the index of the element:

\begin{scalacode}
def buildList[A](length: Int, f: Int => A): List[A]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{mapList} function, which maps each element to a list and returns
the list of all results:

\begin{scalacode}
def mapList[A, B](alist: List[A], f: A => List[B]): List[B]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{partition(f, alist)} function, which splits a list into
two sub-lists, where the first list has all the elements of \scalainline{alist}
on which \scalainline{f} produces \scalainline{true} and the second
list has all the elements of \scalainline{alist} on which \scalainline{f}
produces \scalainline{false}.

The ordering of elements in the two sub-lists should be the same
as in \scalainline{alist}.

\begin{scalacode}
def partition[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[A]): (List[A], List[A])
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{merge(lessThan, alist1, alist2)} function, which merges
the elements of the two lists. You should assume that \scalainline{alist1}
and \scalainline{alist2} are sorted by the ordering defined by \scalainline{lessThan}.
the produced list should also be sorted by the same ordering.

\begin{scalacode}
def merge[A](lessThan: (A, A) => Boolean, alist1: List[A], alist2: List[A]): List[A]
\end{scalacode}

\item
Write the \scalainline{sort(lessThan, alist)} function, which sorts \scalainline{alist} by the ordering
defined by \scalainline{lessThan}.

\begin{scalacode}
def sort[A](lessThan: (A, A) => Boolean, alist: List[A]): List[A]
\end{scalacode}


\item \textbf{(Not graded.)}  The lecture notes discuss the
\lstinline|fold| function, which is reproduced below:
\begin{lstlisting}
def fold[A,B](baseCase: B, binOp: (A, B) => B, alist: List[A]): B = alist match {
  case Nil => baseCase
  case head :: tail => binOp(head, fold(baseCase, binOp, tail))
}
\end{lstlisting}

Rewrite the following functions using \lstinline|fold|. (i.e., do not directly
recur; let \lstinline|fold| handle recursion.)

\begin{lstlisting}
def length[A](alist: List[A]): Int = alist match {
  case Nil => 0
  case _ :: tail => 1 + length(tail)
}
  
def filter[A](f: A => Boolean, alist: List[Int]): List[A] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case head :: tail => f(head) match {
    case true => head :: filter(f, tail)
    case false => filter(f, tail)
  }
}

def map(f: Int => Int, alist: List[Int]): List[Int] = alist match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case h :: t => f(h) :: map(f, t)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \textbf{(Not graded.)} A folding function collapses a list into a value.
Conversely, an unfolding function builds a list from a sequence of values and
terminates the list when a condition becomes true. The general recursive
pattern of an unfolding function is shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}
def unfold[A,B](stop: B => Boolean, gen: B => (A, B), v: B): List[A] = {
  if (stop(v)) {
    Nil
  }
  else {
    val (x, vNext) = gen(v)
    x :: unfold(stop, gen, vNext)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Use \lstinline|unfold| to write \lstinline|map| and \lstinline|filter|.

\item \textbf{(Not graded.)} Write a \lstinline|sort| function that uses
a combination of \lstinline|fold| and \lstinline|unfold| instead of direct
recursion. You may need to use \lstinline|fold| and/or \lstinline|unfold| several times.

\end{enumerate}

\appendix

\chapter{Lesson Plan: Introduction}
\savepdf{instructor-intro}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Introduce the course VM.


\item Briefly introduce the console and start \verb|sbt console|.

\item Show basic boolean and arithmetic expressions.

\item Declare a variable with \lstinline|val|. Talk through the output.
Show \emph{type inference}.

\item Define the \lstinline|twice| and \lstinline|double| functions.
Do not use a block. Explain the notation.

\item Declare a function with local variables, e.g., distance between
two points.

\item Introduce projects: in principle you can write a whole program
line by line. But, we want to save files.

\item  Introduce \verb|mkdir|, \verb|cd|, and, \verb|ls|

\item Slowly talk through the command-line commands involved in
creating, changing to it, and starting \sbt{}. Create
the \texttt{plugins.sbt} file with the line

\begin{lstlisting}
addSbtPlugin("edu.umass.cs" % "compsci220" % "1.1.0")
\end{lstlisting}

\item Use a text editor to create a file with one of the function
we wrote earlier. Handwave through the top-level object.
 \textbf{Scala wart:} Do not \verb|extend App| because it can't be evaluated in console.

\item Start SBT console and import the object. Show that its names
are available.

\item Propose a new function to write. Write the test-cases first, then
the implementation and re-run \verb|sbt test|.

\item Recap the development methodology: first write tests cases, then
write the implementation, and re-test continuously. Show continuous
testing with \verb|~test|.

\item Lists and patterns

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Show the list constructors
  \item Show the fully-parenthesized notation
  \item Show the \lstinline|List| shorthand. Explain that all is the same.
  \item Show that Scala is inferring types for the list.
  \item Write a list-producing function, such as fromTo
  \item Propose writing a list-consuming function, such as sum. There are two cases.
  \item Show pattern matching
  \item Write the count-ones function with a conditional
  \item Make it shorter using complex patterns
  \item Show exhaustivity checking by deleting a case
  \item Show unreachability checking by deleting a case

\end{enumerate}

\item Immutability

\begin{enumerate}

  \item From the console: show that our list-producing functions do not
  change the original list

  \item Show that you cannot redefine vals in files

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Lesson Plan: Pattern Matching and Testing}
\savepdf{instructor-pattern-matching}

\lstset{language=scala}

\section*{Lesson Plan}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Previous lecture recap:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Slowly talk through the command-line commands involved in
  creating, changing to it, and starting \sbt{}. Create
  the \texttt{plugins.sbt} file with the line

  \begin{lstlisting}
  addSbtPlugin("edu.umass.cs" % "compsci220" % "1.1.0")
  \end{lstlisting}

  \item Create a file with\lstinline|repeatTwice(alist: List[Int]): List[Int]|.

  \item Create a test-suite for the function and run it using \sbt{}.

  \item Emphasize immutability using the console.

  \item Create \lstinline|countTens(alist: List[Int]): Int|.

  \item Show exhuastivity check (forget a case) and reachability check (reorder cases).

  \item Show complex patterns (e.g., matching 2nd item in a list).

\end{enumerate}

  \item \lstinline|Time| class in Java vs. Scala: it's a lot shorter

  \item case classes: no need to write new, all fields public, toString and equals that make sense.

  \item Write \lstinline|tick(atime: Time): Time| without pattern matching.
  
  \item Pattern matching on \lstinline|Time|:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def tick(atime: Time): Time = atime match {
    case Time(23, 59, 59) => Time(0, 0, 0)
    case Time(h, 59, 59) => Time(h + 1, 0, 0)
    case Time(h, m, 59) => Time(h, m + 1, 0)
    case Time(h, m, s) => Time(h, m, s + 1)
  }
  \end{scalacode}

  \item Introduce \lstinline|Time12| and write \lstinline|during220(atime: Any): Boolean|.

  \item Emphasize that we can get a runtime error if we mis-apply the function.

  \item Introduce \lstinline|trait Timey| and change type.

  \item Introduce \lstinline|sealed trait Timey| and show that we get exhaustivity checks.

  \item Main point: your data structures can leverage
  exhuastivity and pattern matching. It is not just for built-in
  types.

  \item Recursive types:

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Define type \lstinline|BinTree| with string keys and integer values.

  \item Write \lstinline|find| and \lstinline|insert| and think about properties.

  \end{enumerate}
 
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Lesson Plan: First-Class Functions I}
\savepdf{instructor-first-class-functions-1}

  
\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Print debugging:} show that printfs can be used in blocks at some point in the lecture.

  \item Generic functions and type inference
  
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Two functions \lstinline|length(alist: List[String]): Int| and \lstinline|length(alist: List[Int]): Int|.

  \item Introduce the \emph{type argument} \lstinline|length[A](alist: List[A]): Int|

  \item Type inference figures out the type parameter: show explicit type argument passing.

  \end{enumerate}

  \item Generic data structures: binary trees and lists.

  \item Higher-order functions (\lstinline|map|):

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Introduce \lstinline|incrs(alist: List[Int]): List[Int]|,
      \lstinline|doubles(alist: List[Int]): List[Int]|, and \lstinline|lengths(alist: List[String]): List[Int]|.

    \item Refactor to use an externally defined function

    \item Introduce \lstinline|map|

    \item Show explicit type-parameter usage

  \end{enumerate}

  \item Show \lstinline|filter| with \lstinline|filterEven| and \lstinline|filterOdd|.

  \item Show \lstinline|takeWhile|.

  \item Show generic sorting by introducing insertion sort.

  \item Show the builtin methods on lists.

\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Lesson Plan: First-Class Functions II}
\savepdf{instructor-first-class-functions-2}

\begin{itemize}

\item Example functions: \lstinline|sum|, \lstinline|product|, \lstinline|concat|. Abstract their differences. 

\item Write \lstinline|fold| without annotations, then reason through the types.

\item Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions (already seen examples).

\item Functions can be nested within other functions (e.g., nest the little helper functions).

\item Functions can produce functions (\lstinline|makeAdder|).

\item Functions do not need to be named. \lstinline|def| is sugar for
  \lstinline|val|. Refactor \lstinline|makeAdder| and show anonymous
  functions used with higher-order functions.

\item Functions can be stored in data structures:
  \lstinline|case class Foo(m1: Int => Int, m2: Int => Int)|.

\item Define \emph{higher-order function} and \emph{first-class function}.

\item Example of scope:

  \begin{scalacode}
  def f(x: Int): Int = {
    val y = x + 10
    y
  }
  f(11)
  y
  \end{scalacode}

\item Example of shadowing: reason through it by
  substitution. \emph{Every line is a Scala program}

\item Object-oriented programming:

\begin{scalacode}
case class Point(
  getX: () => Double,
  getY: () => Double,
  mag: () => Double,
  add => Point => Point)

def makePoint(x: Double, y: Double): Point = ...
\end{scalacode}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Lesson Plan: Handling Errors}
\savepdf{instructor-option-type}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item How do we represent partial functions:
  
    \begin{enumerate}
  
      \item Throwing exceptions: \lstinline|Integer.parseInt("hello")|
  
      \item Producing \lstinline|null|: \lstinline|get| method of
        \lstinline|java.util.Hashtable|.
  
      \item Producing \lstinline|NaN|:
  \begin{scalacode}
   case class Point(x: Double, y: Double)
  
   def inter(m1: Double, b1: Double, m2: Double, b2: Double): Point = {
     val x = (b2 - b1) / (m1 - m2)
     Point(x, m1 * x + b1)
   }
  \end{scalacode}
  
        
    \end{enumerate}
  
    \item Problem summary: the types of these functions are a lie. And
      you have to remember how they are lying to you.
  
    \item Use \lstinline|SomePoint| and \lstinline|NoPoint| to refactor.
  
    \item Refactor using \lstinline|Option[Point]|
  
    \item Not only useful for you, but \lstinline|Option[A]| is used all over
      Scala libraries.
  
    \item Some examples of builtin list-processing functions:
      \lstinline|take|, \lstinline|exists|, \lstinline|forall|,
      \lstinline|map|. Show that \lstinline|:::| is an ordinary method.
  
    \item The \lstinline|Set| type and methods on it.
  
    \item Show the built-in \scalainline|Map| and its \scalainline|get|
      method. Unpack the notation for adding elements to a map.
  
    \item Show conversions between data structures (\lstinline|.toList|,
      \lstinline|.toMap|, etc.)
  
    \item Data wrangling demo:
  
      \begin{enumerate}
  
        
    \item Visit \url{https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data} and show what's
    there.
  
    \item Explain CSV files
  
    \item Download the file
  
    \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/congress-age/congress-terms.csv}
  
    \item Explain \texttt{build.sbt}
  
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \scalafile{code/wrangling/Main.scala}
  
  \end{enumerate}

\chapter{Lesson Plan: Expression Problem}
\savepdf{instructor-expression-problem}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Create a project called \lstinline|fshapes| and give it a
    name, organization, and version number \lstinline|build.sbt|.
    
  \item Define the \lstinline{fshapes} library, with
    \lstinline|Circle(radius)| and \lstinline|Square(side)| as case
    classes and a function \lstinline|inShape(s: Shape, x: Double, y: Double)| that
    uses pattern matching.

  \item Show \lstinline|publishLocal|.

  \item Create a project called \lstinline|jshapes| and fill \lstinline|build.sbt|
   as before.

   \item Show a Point class (not a case class). Show how to make fields
    public, show how to define methods and derived fields.

  \item Show that the entire body of the class can be thought of as a
    constructor, by putting a println in the body.

  \item Delete \lstinline|Point| and create two classes (not case-classes) that
    implement the \lstinline|Shape| trait.

  \item Translate the \lstinline|inShape| function into a method in \lstinline|Shape|
    that uses \lstinline|.isInstanceOf| and \lstinline|.asInstanceOf| instead of
    pattern matching. Say this is terrible.

  \item Rewrite \lstinline|inShape| using dynamic dispatch: note that
    the method bodies are exactly the same as the cases in the
    functional version! \textbf{Make the fields private.}

  \item Recipe: a function that pattern matches, turns into a method on the interface
    and each case becomes an implementation in the corresponding class.

  \item Exhaustivity check: Scala gives you an exhaustivity check in
    the functional code, but we don't have the exhaustivity check.

  \item Using libraries: suppose we found \lstinline|fshapes| and \lstinline|jshapes|
    on the Web. Which should we use? Is it just a matter of style, or are there objective
    criteria for preferring one over the other?

  \item A library is rarely ``complete''. We typically need to extend it. Suppose we
    don't want to edit the source code (or cannot do so).

  \item Add a new \emph{feature} to both libraries: the ability to
    double a shape in size. It is easy in the functional case. In the
    object-oriented case, we need to write a \lstinline|growShape|
    function using type-tests. \textbf{But, this fails because the
      fields are private.} We need to write a wrapper instead. Lots of extra code!

  \item Add anew \emph{data type} to both libraries: easy in the object-oriented
    case. It can't be done in the functional case without a wrapper. Lots of extra code!

  \item Which library should you pick? The one that supports the extensions that you
    anticipate needing to make. What if you want to do both? You're screwed!

\end{enumerate}
